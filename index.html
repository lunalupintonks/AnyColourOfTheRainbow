                </figure>Congratulations! You have taken the first step to
                achieving salon results at home. This easy step-by-step guide
                will walk you through every area of the hair colouring process,
                with practical advice, tips and diagrams.
                <p>

                <p><strong>Note: Please read this guide all the way through
                before you buy any product or start colouring your
                hair.</strong></p>

                <p>Colouring your hair is great fun and with a bit of
                creativity the sky's the limit. No matter if you are goth,
                scene, punk, emo, hippy, or just want to stand out from the
                crowd then creative hair colour is a great way to express your
                individuality.</p>

                <p>Be inspired to try new things. For me the Rainbow hair
                colour is my signature style, but I'm always experimenting. The
                great thing about this dye is that you could have a different
                colour each month if you wanted. I'll teach you how, but what
                colours you want to do is up to you!</p><img alt="Image" class=

                </header>

                <h3>Why lighten the hair first?</h3>

                <p>As you may know white reflects light and black absorbs it.
                White is also the absence of all colour and so reflects all
                colours. Where as black is a combination of all colours and
                absorbs all colours.</p>

                <p>These basic rules apply to hair colour as well.</p>

                <p>So if you use a vibrant hair colour, for example blue, and
                you colour black hair with it, you won't see the blue very much
                at all. You will probably only get a very slight hint of blue
                under strong sunlight. However if you apply the exact same blue
                dye to very light blonde hair, you will see a truly vibrant
                blue under most light.</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/blue_light.png"><br>

                <p>This is because the blue colour pigments are reflected by
                light perfectly on a white base, and have no other other colour
                pigments to alter them. However on the black base the blue
                can't be reflected because the black absorbs the light, and the
                blue can't be it's true colour because all the other colour
                pigments are present in black and so the blue is altered.</p>

                <p>This is why we must lighten the hair to get vibrant results.
                The lighter the hair the truer the rainbow dye colour can
                be.</p>

                <h3>What if the hair is already white, or naturally
                blonde?</h3>

                <p>You can use the crazy colours directly on your natural hair
                and you will get a good result. However, I have found from
                experience the colour will fade a lot faster on non-lightened
                natural hair. I have also found the colours to be a less
                vibrant and more soft/pastel in tone than on a pre-lightened
                hair.</p>

                <p>This is because naturally light hair is less
                porous/absorbent than hair that has been chemically lightened.
                This means it doesn't grab and hold the colourful dye very
                well. If you only want the colour to last a week or two then
                this is fine, use a deeper shade then the colour you desire.
                For example if you want a standard blue I suggest you use a
                deeper 'midnight blue' shade as it will lighten a lot with each
                wash.</p>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/bleachgray.png">
                </figure>

                <p>Another thing to note with naturally light blonde hair: You
                will find your natural colour, even if it is very light, will
                still have golden yellow tones in it. Using a shade like blue,
                the natural golden yellow in your own hair will effect the
                result and give you a more greenish blue. As it washes out you
                may even find it changes to a light green as the level of blue
                pigments decreases and you own gold tones show through (blue +
                yellow = green).</p>

                <p>With naturally white hair this will not happen as there are
                no existing colour pigment left in the hair.</p>

                <p>You will find it fades faster than hair that has been
                chemically lightened. With white hair you may find greys mixed
                in, and for this reason I would still choose to bleach the hair
                in the first instance to give you a good clean base for the
                rainbow colours. This way the colour will also last much
                longer.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Colour will fade a lot faster on non-lightened
                            white, or naturally light blonde hair. So I would
                            recommend you bleach the hair first if you want the
                            colour to last.</p>

                <h3>Are there any exceptions where I don't need to bleach my
                hair first?</h3>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/Red%20hair%20Anya.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>Yes! Red and Orange.</p>

                <p>Red and Orange are the only colours that are available in a
                hi-lift dye. This is where you apply the dye and it both
                lightens and deposits pigments in one step. No pre-bleaching
                needed. Plus these dyes are permanent. This is perfect for
                those of you who want a full head of vibrant red, a few streaks
                of red and orange, or maybe a bright red fringe. It saves time,
                money and the condition of your hair. Awesome stuff. I'll go
                into more detail and give you the brands and shades in the 'Dye
                Products' section. I'll explain how to apply in the 'One
                Colour' section and how to maintain this type of dye in the
                'Maintenance' section. So if you are planing on going Hayley
                Williams colours or Little Mermaid red all over please look out
                for this info as we go.</p>

                <h3>What are the best products to lighten hair and what
                shouldn't I use?</h3>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/wrong.png">
                </figure>

                <p>The best way to lighten hair is with bleach. The reason a
                lot of people have problems with lightening their hair is
                because they use the wrong product. Often people will buy a box
                of blonde tint/dye off the supermarket shelf and end up with
                orange/yellow hair. Tint/dye is NOT bleach and works
                differently.</p>

                <p>Another reason people use a tint/dye rather than a bleach is
                because they have heard horror stories about bleach being used
                in the wrong hands. The truth is that bleach causes almost the
                same amount of damage to the hair as some tint products. In
                fact bleach has come a long way since your mums days of
                streaking caps. Today you can even get ammonia free bleach,
                which hardly causes any damage! Once you have that blonde
                pre-lightened hair you can swap and change the funky colours
                with out having to re-bleach again. (NOTE: There are a few
                exception to this which I will cover in the 'Future Changes'
                section). Bleach generally come in a powder form and is mixed
                with Hydrogen Peroxide developer cream.</p>

                <h3>What is Hydrogen Peroxide Developer Cream?</h3>

                <p>Hydrogen peroxide developer cream, also know as "Oxidant",
                "Developer" or "Activator" is what is mixed with all standard
                tint/dye and bleach products. Normally it comes as a cream in a
                bottle. The hydrogen peroxide developer cream works by opening
                the hair's protective cuticle's to allow colour pigments to
                either be removed or to be replaced (similar to the way a pine
                cone opens with heat). When hydrogen peroxide developer cream
                is mixed with bleach powder it removes the natural colour
                pigments in the hair leaving the hair a pale yellow colour. The
                amount and speed of natural colour pigments that are removed
                from the hair depends on the strength of hydrogen peroxide
                developer. Peroxide developer is available in three
                strengths...</p>

                <h3>What bleach powder should i use?</h3>

                <p>Bleach powder is mostly the same across all brands. The
                level of peroxide developer that is mixed with the bleach
                powder is what changes the strength and result. However bleach
                powder does come in two types:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>ON Scalp:</strong> If you wish to do an all
                        over scalp bleach you will need an ON scalp bleach
                        powder. These are more gentle and suitable to apply
                        directly to the scalp. This type of bleach is also
                        available for people with sensitive scalps.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>OFF Scalp:</strong> If you wish to do
                        streaks of colour in foil (which would not touch the
                        scalp) you can use ether type of bleach. However the
                        OFF scalp type is usually sightly stronger and would be
                        most suitable for doing streaks in already dyed or
                        darker hair types.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul><img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/bleach_bag.png"><br>

                <p>Another thing you will want to consider when choosing your
                bleach is cost and quantity. All of the professional bleach and
                developer products come in large amounts, as they are intended
                for salons, but they are also the best value for money, and
                give far better results than any supermarket product. Purchase
                a big tub or bag and it will last you a year or more, which is
                economical if you intend on touching up your roots as they grow
                out. Share a bag with a friend, and even do each others
                hair.</p>

                <p>However I understand some of you may want a smaller amount
                for a one off bleach. For this you can get bleach kits which
                come with both bleach and peroxide and are designed for a
                single use.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>It is possible to mix developer with a differant
                            brand of bleach powder. But for best results when
                            mixing bleach powder and peroxide developer stay
                            within the brand and product range. So if you use a
                            L'Oréal bleach, ideally you should mix it with the
                            corresponding L'Oréal peroxide developer.</p>

                <p>I love using this brand. Brilliant value for money for a
                professional bleach and works perfectly for achieving a creamy
                blonde on both coloured and natural hair. Gives up to 7 levels
                of lift. The Super Blue is more gentle and suitable for both on
                and off scalp.<img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/Salon_Smart_Bleach50g.png"> Powder is blue in colour
                and can be mixed to a nice constancy to work with. Mix ratio is

                <p>The Ammonia Free version of Super Blue is much the same, but
                kinder to the hair and without the ammonia smell. This version
                also doesn't swell or expand as much. It is also a "Rapid
                Formula" so works a bit faster, so keep an eye on it! Also

                the hair, and I find the constancy wonderful to work with, both

                blue in colour. Maximum development time is 50min without heat.
                Mix ratio is approximately 1:1 – 1:2 (for example 10g bleach

                blue powder, same mix ratio, and same development time. It's
                available in a big tub (453g/16oz) and in small sachets
                (28g/1oz). You can get this bleach from Sally Beauty supply</p><br>

                <p>This bleach powder is L'Oréal's OFF Scalp bleach. It gives 7
                levels of lift on natural hair and up to 5 levels of lift on
                dyed hair. Because it is an off scalp bleach it is stronger
                than Platifiz and harsher on the hair. I only use this bleach
                when lightening dyed hair and naturally dark and strong Asian
                type hair. The powder is white in colour. Maximum development
                time is 50min without heat. Mix ratio is approximately 1:1 –
                1:2 (for example 10g bleach powder to 10g – 20g peroxide
                developer.) The bleach (like most bleaches) swells and expands
                as it develops. Don't apply too much in foils or it will expand
                and leak.</p><br>

                <p>This is my new favorite bleach powder! It was only launched
                by L’Oréal in November 2012, it's a high-powered lightening
                powder with up to 8 levels of lift, but it's also gentle and
                can be used on the scalp. It gives the highest and fastest
                level of lightening in the L’Oréal bleach range. It also has
                'Pro-Keratine' (Keratine is what your hair is made out of)
                which helps to strengthen and condition the hair at the same
                time. Love it! Dust free powder so you don't breath it in when
                mixing. Mix ratio is approximately 1:1 – 1:2 (for example 10g
                bleach powder to 10g – 20g peroxide developer.) Can be used for
                full head scalp bleach and in foils. The powder is blue in
                colour. Maximum development time is 50min without heat.
                Suitable for all hair types, both coloured, natural and dark
                hair. I have personally used this on my own scalp and found it
                to be the most gentle bleach I've ever tried. Practically no
                discomfort when compared to other on scalp bleachs. This is my
                number one recommendation for a bleach.</p><br>

                <h3>L'oreal Platinum Range:</h3>

                <p>The Platinum range from L'Oréal Professional is the most
                gentle bleach available. It contains white beeswax and lipids
                which maintain 100% of the hair's outer lipidic layer. This
                barrier layer gives the hair elasticity, shine, and protects
                the cuticles. This means the Platinum range of bleach can
                lighten the hair by 7 levels and still maintain the hair's
                optimum condition. Perfect for those with weak or dry hair, who
                don't want a harsh bleach. These bleaches are not powders, but
                pastes, and can only be mixed with the corresponding Platinum
                Nutri-developers. They are one of the most expensive ranges of
                bleach out there, but worth the money if you are concerned
                about the condition of your hair.</p>

                <p>Platinum Plus is the stronger of the two bleach pastes in
                this range, but it is still gentle enough to use on the scalp.
                Ideal for dyed, or natural darker hair types. Best on medium to
                coarse hair. This bleach doesn't swell or expand like most
                bleaches do. This is great in foils as you don't need to worry
                about it bleeding or leaking out. Also great for touching up
                the roots as you don't get a swelling of bleach that can
                overlap onto previously bleached hair. The paste texture can
                make it difficult to mix together with the Nutri-developer, you
                have to work at it to get the lumps out! But once mixed it is a
                nice constancy to work with. I have personally used this on my
                own scalp and found it to have minimal discomfort. However
                because it is a gentle bleach I found 30vol was needed to get
                the same result I would normally get with 20vol and a classic
                powder bleach. Even with the higher developer, the condition
                still felt better than the result you get with a classic powder
                bleach. Mix ratio is approximately 1:1 – 1:2 (for example 10g
                Platinum Plus bleach paste to 10g – 20g Nutri-developer.)
                Maximum development time is 50min without heat.</p><br>

                <p>Platinum Ammonia Free bleach paste is the weaker and most
                gentle of the two bleach pastes in this range. L'Oréal says
                this can be used ON scalp, however I have personally used this
                on my own scalp and found it to be the most painful experience
                of a scalp bleach EVER! It itched like a thousand mosquito
                bites all over my head, totally unbearable. This may have just
                been a personal reaction, but you can understand why I have
                never used it on a clients scalp after that experience. However
                the condition of my hair was the most amazing after, almost
                felt like it hadn't even been bleached! So I'll leave it up you
                if you want to use this on your scalp, but I would recommend a
                skin test first. (Which is what I should have done, but I
                foolishly presumed such a gentle and ammonia free bleach would
                be kinder on my scalp than the regular powder bleach. Lesson
                learned, always do a skin test when using a new product!) Apart
                from that experience I love using this bleach in foil,
                beautiful results and wonderful condition.</p>

                <p>This bleach is ideal for naturally lighter hair types.
                Lightens the hair by 7 levels. Best on medium to fine hair.
                This bleach doesn't swell or expand like most bleaches do. This
                is great in foils as you don't need to worry about it bleeding
                or leaking out. The paste texture can make it difficult to mix

                <p>Brilliant value for money for a professional bleach and
                works perfectly for achieving a creamy blonde on both coloured
                and natural hair. Works even on darker hair types. Powder is
                blue in colour and has a lovely fruity, floral smell. Contains
                gardenia and coconut oils which stops this product from drying
                out while developing, and also helps to maintain the condition
                of the hair. However the oil does make it a little more
                stubborn to shampoo out. I'd suggest you give three washes with
                a strong shampoo to help ensure it's all gone. Mix ratio is
                approximately 1:1 – 1:2 (for example 10g bleach powder to 10g –
                20g peroxide developer.) Maximum development time is 50min.
                This stuff works FAST so keep a close eye on it, and wash it
                out as soon as you reach the desired shade. Do NOT add heat
                during development, this bleach will heat up on its own.
                Although this is an On scalp bleach, I know a few people who
                have had reactions to this bleach and found it irritating on
                the scalp, so I suggest you do a skin test first to make sure
                this one suites your skin. Only use 6% (20vol) or 9% (30vol)
                with on scalp application. Never use 12% (40vol) on scalp. For
                the price you pay, it's a fantastic bleach, gives good results
                and leaves the hair in great condition. Also available in

                <p>The same as the Ion Bleach Powder above this is brilliant
                value for money for a professional bleach. Main differences are
                that this one has no ammonia, and is not as strong. I wouldn't
                use it on dyed hair. Gives best results on natural light brown
                or lighter hair. Has a lovely smell, and of course no ammonia.
                Mix ratio is approximately 1:1 – 1:2 (for example 10g bleach
                powder to 10g – 20g peroxide developer.) Maximum development
                time is 50min. This stuff works FAST so keep a close eye on it,
                and wash it out as soon as you reach the desired shade. Do NOT
                add heat during development, this bleach will heat up on its
                own. Can be used for both on and off scalp applications, but
                ONLY USE 6% (20vol) if you are applying to the scalp. For the

                <p>These peroxide developer creams (Oxidant Cream) come in 3
                levels: 6% (20vol), 9% (30vol) and 12% (40vol). They are
                designed to be mixed with the Ion bleach powders. Mix ratio is
                approximately 1:1 – 1:2 (for example 10g bleach powder to 10g –
                20g peroxide developer.) The 12% (40vol) level developer says
                you can use on scalp for 2 levels of lift, but this is in
                reference to mixing with the tint/dye colours. The bleach
                powders give up to 7 levels of lift, so don't use 12% (40vol)
                level developer on the scalp with bleach powder. As a general
                rule I never use 12% (40vol) for scalp bleach. These peroxide
                developers are designed for sensitive scalps, so if you have a
                sensitive scalp and want to do a scalp bleach use 6% (20vol) or
                9% (30vol) (depending to the desired level of lift). The
                consistency is more liquid, which makes applying the bleach
                drippy, but easy to spread, and also helps stop the bleach from
                drying out while developing.</p><br>

                <h3>Semi-permanent Dyes:</h3>

                <p>Also know as 'Direct Dyes'. These semi-permanent alternative
                dyes are all synthetic, contain no ammonia and should NEVER be
                mixed with peroxide developer. They work as a deposit only dye,
                which means they simply stain and deposit pigment on the hair
                surface rather then breaking into the core of the hair like
                most permanent chemical tints/dyes do. Because these are
                deposit only dyes, it also means they do not lighten or lift at
                all, this is why the hair needs to be lightened first before
                using this kind of dye. If fact they are so kind to the hair
                it's like applying conditioner. So it is totally safe to
                re-apply again and again to refresh your colour as often as you
                like with zero damage. Awesome stuff!</p>

                <p>Here I have listed as many hair dye brands as I know of. A
                lot of them I have personally used, either on myself or on
                client's hair. The brands I haven't used I've researched to
                provide you as much information about them as possible. However
                please remember that everyones hair is different. So where one
                brand may work well for one person, it may not give the exact
                same result for your hair. I have done my best to give you as
                much information as possible so that you may make your own
                informed choice. And I would also encourage you to experiment
                with different brands until you find what works for you and
                your hair. I have rated the brands 1 - 5 stars, with 5 being
                the best rating.</p>

                <p>This product is intended for professionals only, but you may
                be able to purchase from a friendly salon supplier. After you
                rise this dye out, Paul Mitchell recommends that you wait 48
                hours before the first shampoo to give INKWORKS time to set
                into the hair. Colours last quite well. This brand has 11
                shades including 'Black' and 'Clear'. The Clear can be used to
                dilute the other vibrant shades to create pastel tones. If you
                dilute the dye to make a paste shade the colour won't last as
                long. Pastel shades will only last 1-2 weeks. Overall this is a
                good dye, colours are vibrant, however it's very expensive
                for the amount of product you get.</p><br>

                <p>This product is a professional range, however it is
                available for retail purchase. You will need to go to a salon
                supplier, or a salon that stocks this range to purchase. The
                dye has a fruity scent. Available in 7 shades. When you squeeze
                the dye out the tube you will see the dye has magic sparkles in
                it. This is just for fun, once the dye is rinsed out your hair
                the sparkles will disappear. This is one of the most expensive
                American brands. You will need two tubes for a full head. You
                can also mix this dye with the Scruples "ER Emergency Repair
                Conditioner" to create pastel shades. If you dilute the dye
                this way to make a paste shade the colour won't last as long.
                Pastel shades will only last 1-2 weeks. Check out the Scruples

                also get the old packaging for a cheaper price on places like

                <p>This product is intended for professionals only, but you may
                be able to purchase from a friendly salon supplier. Comes out a
                bit darker than it looks in the tube. I have seen this brand
                online for as low as $18. Recommended processing time is 10
                minutes under low heat and a 5 minute cool down time. It's
                important to allow the hair to cool down before rinsing this
                dye out. You can also do longer than 10 minutes under low heat
                for a more long lasting colour. This brand comes in 8 shades.
                The tubes are very big, one tube can do two full head
                applications, so if you have very thick or long hair then it
                would be a great brand for you. Colours can be mixed to create
                your own unique shades. Vibrant and long lasting. This brand is
                good value for money compared to other 'professional only'
                brands.</p><br>

                <p>This brand claims on their website to be; "The most intense,
                long-lasting, semi-permanent hair colour out there." And they
                are right. If you want a super long lasting, strong hold
                semi-permanent this is your brand. In fact some shades such as
                the 'Atomic Pink' are so long lasting I think they should be
                classes as permanent, because they simply never leave your
                hair, and can in fact be quite hard to remove. This is great if
                you want the same colours for a long time, but if you like to
                change your colours often this may not be the best brand for
                you. The consistency is quite thick so you do have to work it
                in to ensure even cover. I don't like the squeeze bottle
                packaging. The consistency makes it is quite hard to squeeze
                the dye out the click open/close lid, (same as RAW dye). I
                normally just unscrew the cap to get the dye out more easily.
                They have a good range of shades, and some glow under UV black
                light. The smell is quite pleasant, reminds me of marzipan or
                marker pens. You only need one bottle to do a full head of
                colour. Overall I love working with this brand and would highly
                recommend it.</p><br>

                <p>This brand is probably one of the most famous and had been
                around since the 70's. With celebrities like Rianna and Katy
                Perry using this brand it's no wonder they are so popular. I
                use this brand quite often, and like all semi-permanent dye
                brands there are pros and cons. Tish &amp; Snooky's Manic Panic
                has a great range of shades, including some that glow under UV
                black light. They also have the 'Amplified' formula which lasts
                30% longer than the 'Classic' Manic Panic. I love the pots they
                come in. I wish all dyes came like this because it's so much
                easier to use straight from the pot. Just dip your brush in,
                then put the lid back on when you're finished for minimum
                product wastage. Which is why I'm frustrated at the new
                'Squeeze' Bottle packaging design for the 'Amplified' range.
                Because it's now in a bottle like 'Special Effects' you have to
                squeeze it out into a bowl to use with a brush, and that means
                product wastage if you don't use everything you squeeze out. Or
                you can squeeze the dye out directly onto you hair for one
                colour all over, but this gets messy. I hope they bring back
                the pot packaging, it's one of the best things about this
                brand. Plus I love to re-use the pots for when I mix up my own
                shade's.</p>

                <p>The consistency of this dye is good, not too thick or
                drippy. The smell is not bad, reminds me of the smell of paint,
                but it's not strong, you have to hold the dye up to your nose
                to smell anything. Like all semi-permanent dyes some shades are
                better that others. One of my favourite shades is the 'Electric
                Banana', it's like a highlighter yellow it's so bright. The
                'Ultra Violet' comes out more blue than it appears in the pot.
                The colours last well, depending what shades you use, however
                they are not the most long lasting of the semi-permanent dye
                brands. If you use the same colour all the time you can get
                'Salon Size' 8oz bottles of dye from salon suppliers, which can
                be better value for money. Manic Panic also make a 'High
                Voltage Intense Colorizing Shampoo', in four shades. This is
                great if you have one colour all over, as the shampoo deposits
                colour, keeping your hair vibrant for longer (not suitable for
                multicoloured hair).</p><br>

                <p>These dyes come in a re-sealable bottle with a click
                open/close lid. However I find the consistency to be very thick
                and hard to squeeze out such a small opening. Instead I suggest
                you simply unscrew the lid top and squeeze the product out
                directly from the bottle. Because of the thick 'paste-like'
                consistency of this dye it can be hard to spread though the
                hair and results can be patchy if you don't take time to really
                work the product into the hair and ensure even coverage. As
                such it's not the easiest product to use in foils, and you will
                need to keep the section of hair fine to ensure the the dye
                penetrates. With 113ml of product you only need one bottle to
                do a full head of colour. It has a nice bubble gum smell.
                Colours are vibrant and last a long time. I've found with some
                of the darker shades the residue colour can be quite hard to
                lift from the hair. Overall this brand is comparable to Special
                Effects, and is slightly cheaper, however of the two, Special
                Effects is the most long lasting.</p><br>

				<p>Splat comes in a box kit which includes splat dye, bleach, peroxide and
			    gloves. The bleach should NOT be used on the scalp. The gloves you get with
			    the kit are quite big. Dye is a gel-like consistency and has a bubblegum
			    smell. Colours last quite well, about 4-6 weeks. These box kits are widely
			    available in America from drug stores and shops like Walmart, Fred Meyer
			    and <a onclick="open_in_user_default_browser(this.href); return false;" href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/i3102mu2-u1HLOPINQKHJJKKMKJL"

			    will be a lot lighter. For example, 'Lusty Lavender' comes out more pink if
			    you don't apply enough dye. Because of this you will need two kits (total
			    $18 USD) for a single full head application.</p>
				
				<img alt="Image" class="floatRight marginLeft" src="images/splatbox.png">

			    <p>You might like that the kit includes bleach, however if it's not needed
			    (i.e. if you need an ON scalp instead) you will need to purchase the dye
			    individually. They come in <a onclick="open_in_user_default_browser(this.href); return false;" href=
			    "http://www.totallyhaircare.com/store/home.php?cat=19" target=

			    being so small you would need 4 sachets for a full head, (total coast $16),
			    so works out to be quite an expensive dye after all.</p>

			    <p>Because this dye requires extra product to get good results, it actually
			    makes it more expensive than some of the professional bands.</p>

                <p>This brand was previously called "Affinage Colour Dynamics"
                so you might still see some in the old packaging, but it's
                still the same product. This is quite a good brand, colours
                last well and are very deep and vibrant. However the range of
                shades is quite limited. The pump tops work well, you can just
                hold your brush under it and pump out the dye directly onto the
                brush (like toothpaste) so mess and product wastage is limited.
                Or you can pump dye into your hands for larger amounts when
                doing an all over application, but this will get messy.
                The down side of the pump top is that it can be hard to reach
                that last bit of colour in the bottom. I love 'Manic Magenta',
                it is a beautiful dark, rich pink colour. Also 'Moody Blue' is
                fantastic, however it's a very green based blue, more like deep
                aqua/teal tone. Has a pleasant smell, like a floral soap. Used
                to come in 250ml/8.45oz in the old 'Affinage Colour Dynamics'
                packaging, now it's the same price but just 200ml. Still a lot
                of product, will do a full head application twice. Good for
                thick or long hair. I have also seen this brand available in
                Australia in some salon suppliers and it is good value for
                money compared to Fudge Paintbox.</p><br>

                <p>This brand is available in the USA, Canada and Mexico, but
                can be a bit harder to get your hands on anywhere else. Comes
                in pot packaging (like Manic Panic and Directions), which I
                love. Makes it easy to use and you can get to every last drop of
                dye. One pot will do a full head application. Price is
                good, I have seen this dye online for as little as $7.50 (USD).
                The consistency is great, it's a creamy gel-like texture,
                perfect for spreading through all over, but not so runny it
                doesn't stick in foils well. Has a very strong grape smell,
                personally I think it smells delicious, but some people find
                the smell to strong, like grape medicine. Instructions say not
                to use conditioner before applying and to leave for 15-30min,
                but I prefer to do an hour. Although it is advertised as
                lasting 5 - 40 washes, this dye is actually very long lasting,
                (5 weeks or longer) not as long as Special Effects, but longer
                than Manic Panic, comparable to Ion or Raw. I've found 'Spring
                Green' to be the fastest fading colour in this range, only
                lasting 2-3 weeks. Colours are not all as advertised, and some
                come out darker than expected. The 'Flamingo Pink' is more of a
                dark magenta pink and 'Ebony' looks more like a dark navy blue.
                Be warned: this dye has a serious amount of running/bleeding
                and stains everything it comes in contact with! It's hard to
                remove from skin, and even weeks after dying it will still be
                running/bleeding a lot with each wash. Even running your
                fingers through dry hair, dye will rub off and stain your nails
                that colour. Most of these types of semi permanent direct dye
                will bleed and stain, but this brand is the worst for
                it.</p><br>

                <p>This is a fairly new range of dye from ION, it was
                launched May 2012. ION has in the past brought out a range of
                bright colours but have not had much success with them. This
                is however a totally new range formulated in Italy.
                They claim it to be the "longest-lasting colors available" and
                I've even heard this range being compared to Pravana Vivids.
                They come in a tube like Vivids, but that's as far as the
                similarity goes. These are not as good as permanent. I'd
                still say Special Effect are the longest lasting as far as
                this type of semi-permanent, direct dyes goes. But that said
                these colours are very long lasting, longer than Manic Panic.
                The price may look cheaper than Manic Panic as well, but if you
                compare the amount of dye you get in a tube with the cost,
                Manic Panic is the better value for money. With only 60ml
                of product you would need two tubes of this brand for a full
                head of colour.</p>

                <p>The consistency is super thick, like oil paint. This makes
                it hard to work with, and time consuming to apply to a full
                head. When using in foils it's better because the thick
                consistency helps the hair stick to the foil, and stops the
                foil slipping or dye bleeding out. But you need to take the
                section of hair for a foil finer, and really work it in, because
                this thick dye doesn't spread easily. The smell of this dye is
                bad, like a damp old rag and it lingers. If you have a
                sensitive nose you might want to try another brand. You'll want
                some super sweet, strong, nice smelling conditioner to try and
                cover the smell of the dye after. The best shade in the range
                is the 'Sky Blue', beautiful colour, lasts very well. Actually
                all the cooler colours are great. The 'Purple' comes out very
                dark but lightens to a lovely shade with a few washes. The
                worst shade is the 'Magenta', it's results are very
                unpredictable, and sometimes it doesn't take at all. Use the
                'Fuschia' shade instead. In April 2013 ION launched 3 new pastel 
                shades for this range; Rose, Azure and Lavender. </p><br>

                <p>This dye is THE cheapest one available (both in the UK and
                USA) but is also an excellent dye! This brand is more targeted
                toward Afro hair types, and can often be found in shops or
                salons that specialise in African hair (e.g., deadlocking,
                braiding, chemical straightening). However this dye can be used
                on all hair types, and works the same way as all the other
                semi-permanent direct dyes listed here. It's available in a
                whopping 40 different shades, including a wide number of
                natural tones as well as the bright rainbow colours. (I've
                mainly listed the bright colours in the chart here, but for the
                full colour chart just click on the name 'Adore Colour' above
                to go to their website.)</p>

                <p><strong>If you are using the bright rainbow
                colours</strong>, you will still need to pre-bleach the hair
                blonde first to get vibrant results. Because these are
                semi-permanent direct dyes, they can not lighten your hair,
                only deposit colour. Vibrant un-natural colours will fade to a
                pastel tone.</p>

                <p><strong>However if you want to use the natural shades DO NOT
                bleach your hair first.</strong> The natural shades (e.g;
                'Mocha', 'Black Velvet'...etc.) are best applied to natural
                hair to add tone or depth. When natural shades are applied to
                bleached or very blonde hair they don't fade out well. Blacks
                fade to a nasty dull greenish gray and browns fade to a flat,
                gross khaki colour. There is a reason and science for why this
                happens, but it's to complicated to explain here. But when you
                apply the natural shades to natural, non-lightened hair they
                fade very nicely back to your own colour.</p>

                <p>This dye is very runny, drippy gel constancy, great for
                spreading though a full head application, but harder to apply
                in foils. However because of the constancy one bottle can
                stretch to two full head applications. Combined with
                how long lasting it is, makes this dye excellent value for
                money. It has a delicious smell, like juice, and leaves the
                hair soft, silky and shiny. Adore has some super bright
                colours, 'Raging Red' comes out a fluorescent pink toned red,
                'Violet Jem' is another stunning colour and 'Aquamarine' comes
                out a beautiful blue/turquoise tone, great for mermaid hair!
                And the colour lasts really well, I'd say 4-6 weeks at least,
                just as good as Manic Panic, if not better. I also find it
                doesn't stain your skin as badly as some other dyes.</p>

                <p>Directions suggest processing for 15 minutes, but I prefer
                to do 50-60 minutes. Also you <strong>MUST USE HEAT</strong>
                for 15 min with cap. It's important to cover this dye or it
                will dry out, and if you don't use heat it won't take as well
                and will fade faster. Overall I really love this brand, it's
                the best value for money, lasts really well, great colours, the
                only reason it's not my favorite is because of the drippy gel
                constancy, and the fact you need heat is a slight
                inconvenience. Otherwise highly recommended!</p><br>

                <p>This brand is not suitable for bright vibrant rainbow hair.
                The reason I have included them here is so you don't get
                confused by the colour chart and think they do bright colour.
                This is a 'Sheer' colour, it's a very liquid dye and is
                designed to give a transparent tone to hair that has just been
                permed or relaxed (chemically straightened). This is basically
                your old lady's 'blue rinse' colour after a perm. Also
                used on dark African hair after being relaxed to add
                shine and tone back into the hair. It best used to add a slight
                tone to natural or gray hair. It is not for getting bright
                colours on bleached hair. For example I know people who have
                tried to get blue by applying 'Mood Indigo' to bleached hair,
                and all you get a silvery blue/gray tone. The colour chart is a
                bit misleading if you don't know what this dye is for. That's
                why I haven't given this dye a rating as I just wanted to raise
                awareness, so you don't buy this thinking it will give you
                bright colour.</p><br>

                <p>This is not a great brand, but then this is one of the
                cheaper USA brands. Colours fade quickly, and you need to
                use heat while processing. Some of the shades don't even take
                unless you add heat. So if you use this brand I would advise
                you wrap foil around the hair while the dye is on. This will
                stop the dye from drying out. Then use a hair dryer and apply
                the hot air to the foil. I'd also suggest you leave on for longer
                than the recommended 10-20 minutes. Try an hour instead for
                better results. Colour don't always come out as advertised, or
                even as seen in the bottle, rather they come out lighter
                than you'd expect. The 'Tripped Up Turquoise' shade is more
                green than blue, and the reds more pink. The
                'Raspberry Kamikaze' is the best shade in this brand, quite
                long lasting, doesn't come out as dark as advertised, more of a
                magenta shade. On the plus side this dye has a very pleasant
                smell and you get a lot of product for the price. One bottle
                would do a full head application.</p><br>

                <p>This brand is available in the USA, Canada and Mexico, but
                can be hard to get hold of anywhere else. It is
                good for a long lasting colour. I'd compare it to Special
                Effects and RAW. It has a very high concentration of colour
                pigments and results are very dark at first. However with each wash, colours
                become brighter before fading. The constancy is quite thick, and hard to get
                out the small click top lid, so just unscrew the lid and
                squeeze out of the bottle. Has a delicious bubblegum smell,
                'Blue Black' smells like grape flavor and 'Purple Plum' more a
                plum flavor scent. This a limited colour range with only 7
                shades and no yellow, orange or green. 'Twisted Teal' is my
                favorite shade from this brand, it lasts really well and is a
                stunning vibrant teal/turquoise colour. The 'Purple Plum' is a
                very blue based purple, and comes out almost a dark navy blue
                at first, and as it fades turns more blueberry purple. Because
                these dyes come out dark at first, they also bleed and mix
                more. For example, if you have a light pink from another brand
                next to a streak of 'Twisted Teal', it will turn some of the
                pink hair more purple. The instructions say to leave for 15min
                development time but I'd suggest longer, 50min or longer for
                better results.</p><a onclick="open_in_user_default_browser(this.href); return false;" href=

                time, so you <em>DON'T HAVE TO PRE- BLEACH</em>. These 3
                colours come in a box kit containing: 5 oz. colour/bleach
                packet, 1 oz. developer/peroxide, gloves, mixing bowl, spatula
                and hook brush. A box cost $10.99. This one step bleach and
                colour product is only for using in foiled streaks, and
                <strong>OFF scalp only</strong>. Not to be used for full head
                applications. Product drys out if it's not covered inside a
                foil. It's not suitable for already bleached hair and will
                cause damage if applied to bleached hair. <em>Must always be
                processed with heat.</em> Processing time is 30 min with heat
                for medium to dark brown natural hair, 15 min with heat for
                naturally lighter hair types. Must be allowed to cool for 5min
                before shampooing out with cool water. This colour is not
                permanent, when the colour fades use the regular N'Rage
                semi-permanent direct dye to brighten it up, don't apply this
                'One Step' bleach colour again the second time, as it will
                damage the hair the same way over bleaching does.</p><br>

                <p>This is one of my least favourite brands. Colour fades very
                fast, which is fine if you need the colour to be gone by the
                end of school holidays, but not if you don't want to be
                re-colouring all the time. This brand is also available in
                Australia. The Hot Pink is the longest lasting in this range
                and is a popular colour. Quite a runny consistency, more
                like a gel. This is good for all over colour as a little goes a
                long way. Makes it difficult to use in foil or for
                more creative techniques. But the biggest reason I don't like
                this brand is because you can't mix it with other brands to
                make new shades. (For example: if you mix Rusk Scream Rocket
                Red with Fudge Paintbox Blue Velvet to try and make purple, it
                may look purple in the bowl but the result on the hair will be
                just be blue.)</p><br>

                <p>This has become a hard to find hair dye since Hot Topic has
                stop selling it and now only stocks the Temporary Comb In and
                Spray Colour in this brand. (NOTE: The Temporary Comb In colour
                that comes in a box is not worth getting.) But the actual
                bottles of semi-permanent dye are great and you can still find
                some of them on places like eBay. Also this dye is very thick,
                so I suggest you cut the tip down lower so it's easier to get
                out.</p><br>

                <p>This is an awesome brand, has been around since the 1970's punk
                era and is one I personally use often. It's the great
                value for money, one bottle will do a full head of colour and
                it's the second cheapest brand out there after Adore Creative
                Image dye (when comparing the recommended retail price and
                amount of product you get). They have a great range of 27
                different shades, the colours are beautiful and the deeper
                shades last around 4 weeks, the lighter shades 2-3weeeks. The
				 'Orange' shade I personally find lasts forever and can
                be quite hard to remove. The constancy can vary a lot.
                Sometimes it's runny, other times thick and sometimes it's
                runny with thick lumps in. If your using this brand I would
                always recommend giving the bottle a good shake to help even
                out the constancy. Some of my favourite shades
                are 'Peacock Blue', 'Aubergine' and 'Pine Green' all beautiful
                colours that fade out well. If you want a blue use the 'Capri
                Blue' and not the 'Sky Blue'. The blue shades aren't as strong
                and deep as some other brands and will go green if you try to
                use them on a very yellow/golden blonde base hair. I also love
                the blonde toning shades 'Platinum' and 'Silver' great for
                getting rid of brassy tones in blond hair. Crazy Colour has
                also recently created 3 new 'Candy Shop' shades... "Bubble Gum
                Blue", "Marshmallow" and "Candyfloss". There is also a
                "Neutral" designed to mix with the other shades to create you
                own pastel tones. Overall this may not be the best brand out
                there, but for the price you pay you get an excellent
                dye.</p><br>

                <p>This is my all time favorite and number one recommendation
                for bright colour. I just LOVE this dye. This brand has been
                around since the 80's, has a great reputation and for me it
                ticks all the boxes... Results match what is advertised on the
                colour chart, colour lasts really well, longer than Manic
                Panic, but not so long that you have trouble trying to change. Value
                for money is fantastic! This is the third cheapest dye out
                there (In the UK) after Crazy Colour and Adore, (when comparing
                the recommended retail price and amount of product you get).
                Colours fade nicely. Constancy is a perfect creamy texture to
                work with, not too runny and not too thick. Fantastic wide range
                of 34 shades, I'm like a kid in a candy bar with the amount of
                choice! Smell is pleasant, but not too strong. Also love the pot
                packaging for easy dip, use and re-seal with no product
                wastage. Plus it's great to re-use the pots when mixing my own
                shades. It's super easy to find in the UK, but Directions also
                has <a onclick="open_in_user_default_browser(this.href); return false;" href="http://www.lariche.co.uk/distributors" target=
                "_blank">distributors world wide</a>.</p>

                <p>If I had to compare this brand to another I'd say it's like
                Manic Panic, only better, cheaper (only in the UK, if you are
                USA then Manic Panic is better value) and longer lasting. But
                some of the shades are almost identical, Directions Fluorescent
                Glow is almost exactly the same shade as Manic Panic Electric
                Banana. Some of my favorite shades are Plum, Dark Tulip, Spring
                Green, Mandarin... ok so this list might get too long! They are
                all awesome. The instructions suggest applying to clean damp
                hair, but I prefer to apply to clean dry hair as I find the
                water in the hair can dilute the dye. Recommended processing
                time is between 15 and 30 minutes. But as with all bright
                colours, the longer you leave it the longer it lasts, so I
                personally do between 50 minutes to 1hr. Does stain
                skin/bathroom/towels, but that's like all bright colours.
                Personally I think if it doesn't stain your skin it won't stain
                your hair. That is basically how this type of dye works.
                The solution is simply to use Vaseline/barrier cream on your
                ears/hairline, use an old towel and just be careful! My only
                complaint with this brand is that I wish it came in bigger
                pots! Double the size and they would be perfect, I find 88ml
                isn't enough for a full head, you would need two pots for a
                full head application. Overall this is a totally brilliant
                brand, fantastic value for money, and would be my first
                recommendation for rainbow dyes.</p><br>

                <p>Prices range between £3 and £5. Compared to other UK brands
                this is is not the best value for money as you only get 70ml of
                product. You would definitely need two bottles if you plan on
                doing a full head of colour. Comes in a box with plastic
                gloves. I suggest you don't cut the nozzle as the product is
                quite thick and hard to get out, and once you cut it you can't
                re-seal the bottle. Instead I suggest you simply unscrew the
                nozzle top and squeeze the product out directly from the
                bottle. This brand has a wide range of shades.
                Some of the shades, such as 'Royal Blue' can be unpredictable
                and not come out as shown on the chart. My favourite shade is
                the 'Magenta', and this brand has also added four new UV shades
                that glow under UV light. The UV Red looks nothing like
                the colour chart, it's more vermilion red and fades to orange.
                Colours fade quite fast.</p><br>

                <p>Comes in a kit box which includes gloves and tint brush. You
                can buy this at Superdrug or online. If you buy from the online
                store they do an offer where you can buy three boxes in the
                same shade for £9.99. However with just 50ml of product this is
                the most expensive UK dye. You would need two boxes
                if you plan on doing a full head of colour. The colour range is
                also very limited with only 6 shades and no green, yellow or
                orange. So you can't do a full rainbow with this brand. Colours
                also fade quite fast. This would not be my first choice for a
                UK brand.</p><br>

                <p>If you are in Australia this is the easiest dye to find, as
                it is available in most salons as well as hair suppliers.
                I've found the price can vary a lot from $12 - $20
                (AUD). If you buy online most sites sell it for $13 (AUD) and
                if you buy in store the RRP is $16. But for just 75ml of
                product this is an expensive brand. You
                need two tubes if you plan on doing a full head of colour. Despite the price, 
				I personally use this brand a lot, the colours are
                beautiful and the deeper shades are long lasting. The
                consistency is great, not runny and drippy, but not too thick or
                hard to spread either. Great for foiling and all over
                applications. 'Blue Velvet', 'Blueberry Hill' and 'Raspberry Beret' 
				are some of my favourite shades in this brand, vibrant and long lasting.
                The lighter shades like 'Pink Moon' and 'Blue Hawaii' only last a
                few washes, they are better used for people who want a short
                term colourful 'toning rinse' effect in their bleached hair.
                Overall I really enjoy using this brand, but find it expensive
                for the amount of product you get. It is also available
                online in the United States. I've featured the new packaging
                here but you can also get the old packaging for a cheaper price
                on places like eBay and Amazon.</p><br>

                <p>This brand is available in Italy, and across Europe. You 
				can also buy it in Australia. It's not bad value for money
                compared to other brands available in Australia (such as
                Fudge). The brand is not as long lasting and with only
                6 shades this is quite a limited colour range. They have a
                lovely but strong sweet smell, reminds me of Ribena
                blackcurrant juice concentrate. Makes the hair smell very nice.
                The twist top nozzle applicator makes applying straight from
                the bottle easy, and the consistency of this dye is very runny
                so it comes out the nozzle applicator no problem. Actually you
                do not want to take the nozzle applicator off and use from the
                bottle directly because the dye is so liquid it just gushes out
                and makes a mess. The liquid consistency does make it very easy
                to spread and work into a full head application, but is more
                tricky to use in foils. Also the twist top nozzle applicator is
                resealable, which I like, much better then the nozzle
                applicators you have to cut leaving the bottle permanently
                open.</p>

                <p>The results with this brand are not particularity intense or
                vibrant and wash out very fast. Perfect if you want a bit
                of short term colour before going back to school or work. The
                colour looks darker in the bottle and while developing on the
                hair, but once it's rinsed off and dried the result is much
                lighter than expected. You might like this brand if your
                looking for pastel tones, because after a few washes that's
                what you get. Particularly the pink, which starts off very
                pastel and light anyway. I don't recommend this brand if you
                want long lasting colour, or deep, vibrant tones. I have also
                seen this dye online cheaper for about $12. The best thing
                about this dye is the smell, however the price is quite high
                for a colour that fades so fast.</p><br>

                <p>This brand is available world wide. You can also buy it in
                Australia from 'Hair Health and Beauty' salon supplier. If you're
                in Australia this is the best value for money dye with a
                massive 250ml of product for just $9.50. Considerably cheaper
                than Fudge Paintbox. Places like Amazon and eBay are also a
                good place to purchase if you live in the USA. The
                down side with this brand is they have only five shades and
                it's a limited colour range. There used to be more
                colours, but the company felt there was not enough demand for
                the other shades and discontinued them. Colours are
                vibrant and last well. Smells like a mixture of fruit and
                flowers. One bottle will do a full head colour twice, so if you
                have very thick or long hair then it would be a great brand for
                you.</p><br>

                <p>Is a very runny, drippy constancy. So if you are doing more
                than one colour I suggest you put them in bowls first and use
                tint brushes to apply to ensure you don't drip or mix colours
                by mistake. But if you are doing one colour all over this is
                great as it spreads well and you can use straight from the
                bottle.</p><br>

                <p>This brand is made in Brazil and I haven't seen it available
                anywhere else. It's available in 37 shades and lasts on average
                a month. They have recently brought out a 8 new pastel
                shades called "Blond extreme" but they don't last as well,
                average 15 washes. The constancy is liquid and runny, making it
                easy to spread through the hair, but harder for foil
                applications. These dyes have a lovely sweet tropical scent.
                Stains quite badly compared with Alfaparf Jean's
                Colour, sticks to clothing and pillow. The big reason I don't
                like this brand is the colour chart on their site. It's made up
                of photos that have been copied from the internet. This is
                misleading for buyers as the results shown are not
                accurate.</p><br>

                <p>Now for those of you who have played the field, tried every
                colour combination and have finally found your perfect shade or
                colour combination, congratulations! Problem is your sick and
                tired of re-applying. So now your looking for a way to settle
                down, and have more serious, long term relationship with your
                hair colour. Well allow me to introduce to you permanent,
                punky, vibrant hair dyes... and these are definitely not for
                those with commitment problems! NOTE: I do not recommend these
                dyes to people who like to experiment with different
                colours.</p><br>

                <p>This is my number one recommendation for permanent, long
                lasting, vibrant colour. This is because it does not contain 
				ammonia and is not mixed with
                peroxide. So this dye causes zero damage. However, like the
                semi-permanent dyes, the hair needs to be pre-bleached first
                before applying your desired shade. Because this is a
                professional product it uses a colour code to identify the
                shades. (Click the image to see the shade chart and colour
                codes). This consistency of this dye is quite globby, like
                partially-set jelly, it can be more tricky to apply, so
                be thorough and work it in. Leave in to develop for a minimum
                of 30 minutes (the longer the better). Also I recommend you
                use two other Goldwell Elumen products to get the best results
                when using this dye.</p>

                <p>This pre-colour treatment is required to prepare the
                pre-bleached hair structure for the Elumen colour. It creates
                optimum polarisation within the hair, which helps to
                anchor the Elumen colour pigments. It's designed to improve the
                durability, vibrancy and intensity of the colour. Use this
                after you have bleached and washed your hair. Apply 'Prepare'
                to the bleached area, leave in and blow-dry. Then apply your
                chosen Elumen 'Pure' colour to the clean, dry, bleached and

                <p>This seals the colour result and reduces the colour
                bleeding. Drives the remaining colour pigments even deeper into
                the hair and locks them in. Reduces colour fade during
                shampooing prolonging the durability of the colour. Essential
                after each application of Elumen 'Pure'. Apply approximately 40
                ml of Elumen Lock to towel dried hair and distribute evenly
                using a wide toothed comb. Leave to process for 5 minutes and
                then rinse only.</p><br>

                <p>This is a permanent colour, however should you wish to
                change your colour in future you can get a product called
                Elumen Return. This will gently remove the hair colour. However
                I would recommend you go to a salon that specialises in this
                service rather that attempt it yourself. This dye also stains
                the skin quite a lot, but you can get Elumen Clean which is the
                stain remover designed to lift this dye off skin.</p>

                <p>Technically these dyes are semi-permanent, but they should
                be classified as permanent as they so long lasting. This is why
                I've listed them here and not with the semi-permanent dyes. The
                great thing with this dye is that does not contain ammonia and
                is not mixed with peroxide, (like Elumen). But again, the hair
                needs to be pre-bleached first before applying your desired
                shade. These colours are vibrant and intense. If you want
                to mix pastel colours with these use the Pravana Silk Degrees
                Demi-Permanent Shine Treatment. The only problem with these
                dyes is that unlike the Elumen Return, these dyes can NOT be
                removed with Pravana’s Artificial Hair Colour Extractor and
                they can't be bleached out either. So once you use these
                colours you have reached the point of no return! On the plus side they are more
                affordable than Elumen, and you don't need the 'Prepare' and
                'Lock' so all round you spend less money. However you also get
                more bleeding with these dyes than with Elumen, and you will
                experience a slight fade over time, but like I said, they
                should be classified as permanent because they won't leave your
                hair. Also the green comes out more of a turquoise shade than a
                true green. Pravana will now have new pastel shades available
                from May 2013.</p>

                - 50ml tube of hair dye.<br>

                <p>So as you can see from the contents of the box , this brand of
                dye is mixed with hydrogen peroxide developer. This means it
                works in the same way as a classic chemical tint would. The
                peroxide developer opens up the protective cuticle layer of the
                hair, which enables the colour pigments to penetrate into the
                core. Because the pigments are inside the hair,
                rather than just staining the surface (like a semi permanent
                direct dye), the colour can not be washed off the surface,
                making this dye permanent.</p>

                <p>Because this dye contains ammonia and is mixed with 9%
                (30vol) peroxide developer, it does cause a little damage to
                the hair (in the same way a normal chemical tint would). On the
                plus side these dyes are A LOT cheaper than Goldwell 'Elumen'.
                One box will do a full head application. So if you are on a budget
                this dye is great, but if you can afford it the Elumen or
                ChromaSilk VIVIDS dye it is is better as it causes no damage at
                all. I would also strongly recommend a skin test first with
                this dye as it does contain chemicals.</p>

                <p><strong>You DO NOT need to pre-bleach the hair if</strong>
                using this dye on naturally light hair such as medium blonde
                (level 8) or lighter. This is because the 9% (30vol) peroxide
                developer gives this dye a few shades of lift/lightening power
                as well as depositing colour. In this case Miracle dye is a
                better option than Elumen or ChromaSilk VIVIDS, because you
                don't need to pre-bleach first to achieve vibrant, permanent
                results. No pre-bleach means better condition hair, time saved
                and money saved on bleach product. Awesome!</p>

                <p><strong>However, you DO need to pre-bleach the hair
                if</strong> using this dye on naturally darker, dark blonde
                (level 7) or darker. Because the 9% (30vol) peroxide developer
                mixed with this dye only gives a few shades of lift/lightening
                power, it is not enough to achieve vibrant results on naturally
                darker hair. In this case you will still need to pre-bleach the
                hair before applying your desired shade in order to get true
                results. Because you will be both bleaching and then using this
                dye with 9% (30vol) peroxide developer there will be some
                damage to the hair compared to using Elumen or ChromaSilk
                VIVIDS. As such I would only recommend this to those with all
                natural, strong or thick hair that is in good condition. This
                is a good option for Asian hair, or strong resistant hair
                types.</p>

                <p><strong>DO NOT use Miracle dye if</strong> your hair is dyed
                or naturally darker and is fine, dry, split, weak or already
                damaged. This is not a suitable dye for you. The pre-bleaching,
                plus the peroxide in the dye would cause too much damage and
                stress on the hair. If the condition of the hair is
                damaged it will not be able to hold the dye. Damaged hair means
                the protective cuticle layer is broken, and so the colour
                pigments in the core will escape through the broken parts of
                this outer layer. In this case the colour may only last as
                little as 2-3 days before it washes out.</p>

                <h3>Red &amp; Orange Hi Lift Permanent Dye (No
                Pre-bleaching):</h3>

                <p>Now if you recall what I said back in the 'Lightening
                Products' chapter about how the only colours you don't need to
                bleach you hair first for are Red and Orange...</p>

                <p>Well allow me to introduce to you this magical hi-lift dye.
                This is where you apply the dye and it both lightens and
                deposits pigments all in one step. No pre-bleaching needed.
                Plus this dye is permanent. It saves time, money and the
                condition of your hair. Magical stuff. So if you are planing on
                going Hayley Williams colours or Little Mermaid red this is
                what you need.</p><br>

                <p>Majicontrast is desinged to work on dark base hair colour,
                both natural and previously dyed. It is a hi lift tint, which
                means you don't need to pre-lighten/bleach and it still gives a
                really intense result. This is a permanent range, and colour
                does not wash out, or fade to blonde like the direct
                semi-permanent dye. However there is still a little fading,
                and change of tone over a few months. This is a professional
                only range and is available at most salon suppliers, and you
                can also buy it online.</p>

                <p>Because this is a chemical dye, not a direct semi-permanent
                dye, it contains ammonia and is mixed with peroxide developer.
                I would recommend a skin test first. This dye may not be
                subtitle if you hair is very dry and damaged. The vibrancy of
                Majicontrast's colours will depend on the strength of peroxide
                you mix it with. Use L'Oreal peroxide developer 6% (20 vol) for
                more subtle colour or 9% (30 vol) or 12% (40 vol) for more
                intense colour. Personally I like to use 9% (30 vol) as I find
                the 12% (40 vol) can be drying on the hair. 12% (40 vol) is
                better suited to thick strong hair types such as Asian
                hair.</p>

                <p>It'll work best on natural or dyed hair shades 3 (darkest
                brown) to 5 (medium brown), with best results on previously
                dyed dark hair. Not recommended for lighter hair types, as reds
                appear more pink and 'washed out' and colour fades fast. The
                Pure Copper can be used on slightly lighter hair shades, both
                dyed and natural, 4 (dark brown) to 6 (light brown). Do not use
                on bleached hair, it would cause damage because it is hi lift,
                and colour results would not be true. Not recommended for
                people with more than 30% white hair.</p>

                <p>Development time is 35min and if you add heat it speeds it
                up to just 15min. Works best in foil, however can be used for a
                full head tint. Because this is a hi lift tint it has the
                normal thicker 'toothpaste' consistency that you get with
                tints. But of course when mixed with the developer it becomes a
                creamy consistency that is easy to apply. Has a strong ammonia
                smell.</p>

                <p>When doing root regrowth touch ups mix with the peroxide as
                normal and apply to roots only and set timer. Then to refresh
                the lengths and ends simply mix equal parts Majicontrast and
                warm water and apply to the rest of your hair. Mixing it with
                water makes this dye a deposit only colour. This means it only
                deposits pigment and doesn't lift/lighten the hair any further.
                Alternatively for a cheaper option to refresh the lengths and
                ends, use one of the semi-permanent direct dyes listed earlier
                (such as Special Effects or Crazy Colour). DO NOT use
                Majicontrast and peroxide over faded lengths and ends, this
                will cause unnecessary damage as it is a hi lift tint. The hair
                was already lightened/lifted in the initial application, and
                now only needs deposit only dye to refresh colour.</p>

                <p>The 'Magenta Red' shade is my personal favorite, it's a
                deeper more red based tone, and fades to a dark pink. The 'Red'
                shade is a brighter red and more orange based, fades to a
                vermilion tone. This is one of the more expensive brands and
                with just 50ml of product it is not great value for money. That
                said I love this range, love the results it gives, and I have
                personally use this on both my own hair and clients
                hair.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=

                    <h4>1. Foil</h4>Used to separate hair, enabling you to
                    create streaks and multiple colours. Kitchen foil works
                    fine, and makes no difference to the results. However I
                    find it thinner and more difficult to work with than salon
                    foil. Salon foil is available at all salon suppliers.

                    <h4>2. Pin Tail comb</h4>The Pin Tail comb has a thin metal
                    tail which is used to draw precise, straight sections
                    in the hair. Use it to pick out or weave small sections of hair 
					for use in foils. It can then be used to precisely fold the foil 
					into a neat package.<br>

                    <h4>3. Plastic mixing bowl</h4>This is used to mix
                    bleach in. You must always mix bleach in a plastic or
                    glass bowl. Do not use a metal bowl. (Further explanation in the
                    'Safe Pre-Lightening' chapter). Although you can use the
                    dye straight from the tube or pot, you will also need
                    mixing bowls if you intend on mixing up your own

                    <h4>4. Tint brush</h4>These come is a range of different

                    colour all over applications, but the smaller ones are
                    better for foils. Get the ones with the
                    pointed tail, as they are great to help section hair as you
                    colour.<br>

                    <h4>5. Rubber gloves</h4>You'll need these if you don't
                    want tie dyed hands or bleach eating into your fingers. You
                    can buy these individually, and some dyes will come with
                    them. But I suggest you buy a pack/box if you intend on
                    touching up and maintaining your roots, it much better
                    value for money. For a fun pack of multicoloured

                    <h4>6. Old t-shirt and towel</h4>Don't dye with your
                    mum's new white towels. Or you really will be dead. Hair
                    colour is a messy business so only wear/use old stuff that
                    you don't mind getting covered in hair dye. <br/>
					Because it will.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>7. Large tooth comb</h4>These are great for combing
                    through products like dye and conditioner in the hair, as
                    there is less resistance than regular combs. (NOTE: Don't
                    comb hair with bleach on, as the hair is very delicate
                    during this process).<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>8. Plastic sectioning clips</h4>You will need these
                    clips to hold your hair in sections. When using bleach you
                    need to use plastic and not metal clips. They come in a
                    wide range of shapes, colours and designs. My personal
                    favourite is the double-hinged design <a onclick="open_in_user_default_browser(this.href); return false;" href=
                    "http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-3670582-10650864?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sallybeauty.com%2Fhair-clips%2FSBS-702122%2Cdefault%2Cpd.html&amp;cjsku=SBS-702122"

                    "1"> as they have a very strong grip, never slip from the
                    hair and are great for holding thick sections. I
                    suggest you get a pack of these, as you will need a few if you want
                    multi colours. Clips are one of those items, like pens
                    and single socks, that fairies really love to steal.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>9. Mirror</h4>An absolute must if you're colouring your own hair, 
					or else you'll be flying blind. If your friend is
                    doing it for you, it's not so essential, but you will
                    probably want to have one anyway so you can keep an eye on
                    them! And of course you'll want to check it all out when
                    it's finished.<br>
                    <img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                    "images/Petroleum%20jelly.png"><br>

                    <h4>10. Barrier cream or Petroleum jelly</h4>Petroleum
                    jelly (Vaseline) or Barrier cream is great for when you are
                    applying dye all over and you don't want that tell-tell
                    hairline stain. I particularly recommend this if you
                    are doing dark colours, as they are the worst for staining skin.
                    Also good if you don't have any stain remover handy for
                    after colouring. Rub some around your hairline before you apply
                    the colour, but be sure not to get it on your hair.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>11. Measuring Scales</h4><img alt="Image" class=
                    "floatLeft" src="images/stainRemover.png"> You'll need these
                    to measure out your bleach powder and peroxide quantity.
                    Any kind will do, even you mum's cooking scales. Just pop
                    the plastic mixing bowl on, set it to zero and away you
                    go.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>12. Stain Remover</h4>This is always a good idea,
                    particularly if you had no barrier cream and now have a
                    stained forehead. I recommend <a onclick="open_in_user_default_browser(this.href); return false;" href=

                <h3>Suppliers:</h3>

                <p>You can buy all the dye, equipment and lightning products
                online or at your local salon supplier. Although I have
                given links to where you can buy each product online, you may
                want to search for your local salon supply store, as you can
                find some products cheaper there. This will save paying
                postage and handling fees. I will list here a few good
                places to shop online and some salon suppliers. With
                the salon suppliers you may not be able to order online unless
                you are a registered professional, as some sites ask for a
                cosmetology license number. You can use the store locater
                on the site to find your local store. Most local salon supply 
				stores will let you walk in and buy anything. In fact a lot salon 
				supply store staff I meet are super helpful and love to give advice 
				and feedback on products. So don't be scared to check them out and ask if your not sure
                about something. I'll also list here a few other good websites
                that specialise in bright rainbow hair dyes.</p><img alt=

                    <h2>Colour Chart</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>What is best brand to use? What dye do you use?</h3>

                <p>I get asked these questions a lot. The truth is I haven't
                found one brand that does every shade perfectly. Some brands
                are great for warm colour, others for cool colours. Some
                brands do great light tones, another brand will do good dark
                tones. So I use quite a wide range of brands to achieve
                the results I want. I also love to mix and make up my own
                tones, even mixing across the different brands. I'll
                explain more about mixing in the 'Mixing Shades' chapter.</p>

                <p>With this colour chart I'm showing my
                favorite dyes for each colour. But as I've said before
                everyone's hair is different, and so is everyone's taste. So
                where I like chocolate flavored ice cream my friend might
                prefer coffee flavor. Same applies to taste in hair dye. I
                might love to use Manic Panic for a dark red, but another
                hairdresser might prefer Directions. Things
                like smell, constancy and how long you want it to last will
                also affect your taste in brands. Personally I don't like my
                colours to last more than 6 weeks because that's how often I'll
                bleach up my roots and have a colour change. So for a pink I
                don't use Special Effects Atomic Pink on myself because it
                lasts too long. However if I had a client who wanted the
                ends of her hair dip dyed bright pink, for a
                long-lasting, low maintenance look, then I would use
                Special Effects Atomic Pink. Because I know she won't need to
                re-colour again for 8 weeks or more.</p>

                <p>As you can see, it's not one-size-fits-all.</p>

                <p>So use this colour chart as a reference, but don't think of
                it as the definitive or absolute catalogue of hair colour. Rather
                think of it more as Anya's personal favourite flavors of colour.
                As you may have a different taste in dye to mine, I would
                encourage you to also make your own colour chart. So when you
                find a shade that you love make a note of it. After all, it's
                everyone having their own taste, opinions and preference that
                gives us the colorful world we live in.</p>

                <p>To use the chart just click on the hair colour swatch to see
                the brand and shade for that colour.</p>

                <p>In order to use bleach safely you need to know how this
                stuff works and a few basic rules. So before we start I'm going
                to get the not so fun but VERY IMPORTANT bit out the way
                first...</p>

                <div class="centeredList">
                    <hr>

                    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">BLEACH RULES:</h3>

                    <h4>1. NEVER use household bleach</h4>Unless you like the idea
                    of a blistering, burnt scalp and bald head? ...Thought
                    not.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>2. NEVER mix bleach powder and peroxide in a metal
                    bowl</h4>The metal ions in the bowl will have an bad
                    reaction with the peroxide.<br>
                    Always mix in plastic or glass.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>3. DON'T put bleach on the scalp if using the 'OFF
                    scalp' bleach powder</h4>A burnt scalp is no fun. I know it
                    might seem obvious but I've seen people do this.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>4. NEVER bleach hair that has metallic salts
                    in</h4>Metallic salts are found in 'Sun-In' Spray and most
                    henna dye. If you have had these in the past and you then
                    try to bleach your hair, the hydrogen peroxide will have an
                    adverse reaction with the metallic salts, turning your hair
                    to mush. So don't bleach if you've had these before. If you
                    are unsure do a strand test. (I'll cover this as we go)<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>5. DON'T bleach up to white</h4>This will cause extreme
                    damage. The lightest you should go is a pale yellow. If you
                    want white hair you should use toner after bleaching. More on this later.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>6. Bleaching over dyed black hair NOT
                    recommended</h4>The hair will go orange. Which is fine
                    if you wanted orange or deep red hair. But if you attempt to
                    bleach agin to try and lift the orange you will cause
                    severe damage to the hair.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>7. Always keep a close watch on hair with bleach on
                    it</h4>Bleach can damage hair if left on for too long. Set
					 a timer and keep an eye on the hair to make sure it's
                    not going too light/white as it can change quickly.<br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>8.NEVER bleach hair that has had perming or chemical
                    straightening solutions.</h4>These solutions will have
                    broken down the structure of the hair. If you have had
                    these in the past and you then try to bleach your hair it
                    will cause serious damage and breakage. So don't bleach if
                    you've had these before. If you are unsure do a strand
                    test. (I'll cover this as we go)<br>
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                </div>

                <p>Bleach uses chemicals, such as peroxide and ammonia, to
                lighten the hair and are harsh to both the hair and skin. <br/>
				A strand and patch test is always recommended, particularly
                for first time users.</p>

                <h3>How to do a patch test:</h3>

                <p>This is recommended for both bleach and dye, particularly if you suffer allergies, 
				have sensitive scalp or have recently had a tattoo or given birth. 
				</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Place a small spot of bleach or dye onto a
                    plaster and then stick on to the skin of the inner
                    forearm.<br></li>

                    <li>Leave in place for 24 hours, then remove
                    and check for any reactions. <br/>Avoid getting the plaster wet
                    during this period.<br></li>

                    <li>If redness, itching, blistering or soreness has
                    developed on the skin in the area covered by the plaster
                    patch, it is possible that you are sensitive to, or have an
                    allergy to the product.<br></li>

                    <li>Wash the affected area in cold running water for 3
                    minutes, do not scrub the area. Do NOT use this product if
                    a reaction occurs.<br></li>

                    <li>If there is no reaction, the product is suitable for
                    you to use.<br></li>

                    <li>If redness, itching, blistering, soreness or some other
                    symptoms persist or worsen after washing the affected
                    area seek medical advice immediately.</li>

                <h3>What can I do with my hair if I am allergic?</h3>

                <p>You can still bleach and dye your hair and do lots of cool colours and effects, but you simply can't apply the product directly to your scalp. The way to do this is by putting the bleach in foil. I will show you how to do this as we go. Of course if you are super sensitive and your allergy is very severe you should discuss this with your doctor before you attempt to colour.</p>

                <h3>What can I do if I have used Henna dye or Sun-In
                Spray?</h3>

                <p>The problem with henna dye and Sun-In products is the
                metallic salts.</p><img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/henna_sunIn.png">

                <p>Metallic salts work by reacting with the sulphur in the
                hair, and gradually over time it builds up on the outer surface
                of the hair. This is why they are also know as 'progressive
                dyes' because each subsequent application increases the coating
                on the hair and the colour progressively becomes more vibrant.
                In the case of Sun-in spray it will continue to lighten 
                after first use, and over time can leave the hair looking
                very bleached and brittle. Although metallic salts sit on the
                surface of the hair they do not wash out. Once you have
                metallic salts on the hair they can not be removed. It has to
                be grown and cut out.</p>

                <p>Metallic salts do not react well with any other
                chemicals.</p>

                <p>If you used henna dye or Sun-In, you will not be able to put
                a regular chemical colour or bleach over it. Any tint dye or
                bleach mixed with peroxide (which is almost all chemical dye)
                will react badly. Any chemical straightening or perm
                solution will react badly. Reactions can result in hair turning
                green, smoking, and melting off. It's like using GHD
                straightening iron on synthetic hair. It turns into chewing
                gum.</p>


                <p>If you have used Sun-In and your
                hair is already golden to light blonde, you can go 
				straight to putting the
                rainbow semi-permanent 'Direct Dyes' in. These semi-permanent
                bright colours (Such as Manic Manic or Special Effects) are not
                mixed with peroxide, and have no ammonia, and so are safe to
                use over hair with metallic salts on.</p>

                <h3>How to do a strand test:</h3>

                <p>This is recommended particularly if you have used perm
                solutions, chemical straightening solutions, 'Sun-In' spray or
                henna dye in the past. Can also help give you an accurate idea
                of the result you will get if you have previously dyed your hair
                and are worried or unsure of the result you would get.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Snip a few hairs from the back or your head or any
                    other area where it won't be noticed.<br></li>

                    <li>Secure the hairs using tape to a foil (you can use
                    kitchen foil)<br></li>

                    <li>Leave dye or bleach on the hair for around 30mins and
                    then rinse as normal.<br></li>

                    <li>Examine the strand carefully to check for any damage or
                    colour inconsistency. To check the level of damage pull a
                    single hair. If it breaks easily, it is damaged and
                    not recommended to bleach.<br></li>

                    <li>If you are happy with the results then proceed with using 
					the product on your own hair</li>
                </ol><br>

                <h3>How does bleach work?</h3>

                <p>You may remember from your art classes in school the
                three primary colours are RED, YELLOW and BLUE. You would
                probably also know that you can mix these three colours to make
                any colour. Well this is true of your natural hair colour as
                well. Inside every single strand of hair sit colour molecules
                and these are made up of the three primary colours.</p>

                <p>These colour molecules come from a natural pigment called
                "Melanin" which your body produces and it also gives skin it's
                colour. The only people with none of the three primary colours
                are people with white hair. Their hair has no colour molecules
                because the body has stopped producing Melanin pigment in the
                hair due to age, stress or hormonal changes.</p>

                <p>The diagram below shows a single hair, cut open so we can
                see the colour molecules inside. We can also see from this
                diagram the natural colour they make when you look at the hair
                from the outside.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage"
                src="images/hairdiagram1.png">

                <p>Now have you ever wondered why people who bleach their hair
                at home often end up with orange or yellow hair? Well it's all
                to do with your 3 primary colour molecules. Remember how
                bleach REMOVES colour from the hair? (As explained in the
                product section.) It removes the the three primary colour
                molecules in five stages...</p>

                <h4>Stage 1: The Blue colour molecules are
                removed.</h4><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/hairdiagram2.png">

                <h4>Stage 2: The orange phase.</h4><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/hairdiagram3.png">

                <h4>Stage 3: The Red colour molecules are
                removed.</h4><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/hairdiagram4.png">

                <h4>Stage 4: The yellow phase.</h4><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/hairdiagram5.png">

                <h4>Stage 5: The yellow colour molecules are
                removed.</h4><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/hairdiagram6.png">

                <h4><span class="redText">Warning!</span> You must shampoo off
                the bleach at this stage. Never let the bleach lighten the hair
                to white.</h4>

                <p>If you were to let the bleach remove all the yellow colour
                molecules, the hair would eventually go white. But you should
                always shampoo off the bleach before the white stage. When the
                bleach has removed all the colour molecules it starts to break
                down the hair structure. This is when serious damage and
                breakage happens, and this is why you should never let the
                bleach lighten the hair to white. If you want white hair you
                will need to use toner to neutralize the yellow tones. I will
                cover this in more detail in the colouring
                section.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/hairdiagram7.png"> <img alt="Image" class="floatRight"

                <h4>Final Hair colour after bleaching: Pale yellow blonde
                (Butter Blonde)</h4>

                <p>This should be the result you get after you have bleached.
                Bleach normally takes between 35 - 40min to reach this pale
                yellow blonde colour. But of course this varies depending on
                your own hair to start with. (For example; If you are already
                naturally a dark blonde then it may take only 25min). Heat
                can speed up the development time by half. (So 20min with heat
                is equal to 40min without). This pale yellow blonde is now the
                perfect base for creating your vibrant rainbow colours.</p><br>

                <h3>How do I mix bleach and peroxide developer?</h3>

                <p>The bleach powder and peroxide developer should be mixed 1:1-2 
				(Unless otherwise stated on the
                instructions). Use some electronic cooking scales to measure
                the amounts.</p>

                <h4>For example:</h4><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage"
                src="images/bleach%20mixing.png">

                <p>Remember you are looking for a creamy consistency, if it
                looks too wet and runny, you need more of the bleach. If it's
                too hard and clumpy your need more of the developer. Wet and
                runny bleach mix works too slowly and won't lighten properly,
                hard and clumpy bleach mix will work too fast, and look patchy
                and uneven.</p>

                <h3>What level of peroxide developer I should mix?</h3>

                <p>Here is a quick re-cap and reference for you from the
                'Lightening Products' section. Simply click on the image's
                below to see what level peroxide should be used on the
                different shades of hair.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>UNLIMITED COLOUR OPTIONS</strong>

                        <p>Full head bleach is great for one bright colour all
                        over, full head of rainbow, multi-colours or two tone
                        (For example one side pink the other side green). In
                        fact the options are endless as to how you can apply
                        the bright colours as you have a totally blank

                        stand-out-from-the-crowd, attention grabbing hair. You
                        will definitely get comments with this.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Cons:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>DAMAGING</strong>

                        <p>Using the right bleach and peroxide level, and
                        correct application will keep damage to an absolute
                        minimum. However if you compare bleached hair with
                        natural hair you will of course feel a difference in
                        the condition. This is something you may wish to
                        consider before you do a full head bleach. Especially
                        if this is your first time bleaching your hair. You may
                        want try doing a streak or panel first to see how bleached
                        hair feels before you commit to a full head bleach.
                        Once you do a full head you will not be able to
                        get the same condition as your old natural hair again
                        without growing it all out.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>HIGH MAINTENANCE</strong>

                        <p>Because you have none or your own natural hair to
                        camouflage the re-growth, when your roots grow out they
                        are very obvious. This means you will need to touch 
                        up your roots every 3-4weeks. Of course it's not a
                        colour option that you can maintain yourself, as you
                        will always depend on someone to help you with the
                        back. Also because the condition of the hair is more
                        sensitive after a full head bleach I recommend you get

                        <strong>EXPENSIVE</strong>

                        <p>Full head application means you will be using the
                        most amount of both bleach and dye compared to other
                        application methods, such as streaks or panels. This
                        means a higher cost as you will need more product for
                        doing a full head. Because you are using the bleach
                        and dye more regularly than with other application
                        methods, it will cost more. You will need to
                        pay for the more regular hair cuts to keep the
                        condition of the hair healthy, and you may want to
                        invest in a good shampoo, conditioner and occasional
                        treatment hair mask. As
                        these will help the condition of the hair. Full head 
						bleach application is not for
                        those who are on a budget.</p>

                <h4>How to apply a Full head bleach on long natural/virgin
                hair...</h4><br>

                <h4>Step 1: Prepare</h4>

                <p>A skin/patch test is strongly advised, especially if this is
                your first time applying bleach to your scalp. Start by wearing
                an old T-shirt. This may get messy. Wear
                rubber gloves (Unless you like an unbearable biting sensation
                of bleach eating away under you finger nails.) Mix up the beach
                before you start, and remember to use the <i>'on-Scalp'</i> bleach for
                the type of application as we will be applying the bleach to
                the scalp later. For a full head bleach I suggest you mix
                approximately 40g <i>'on-Scalp'</i> bleach powder and 80g peroxide
                developer (you may need more for thicker or longer hair). Also
                for this type of application I would advise you get the help of
                a friend or family member, as doing the back of your own head
                can be very tricky, but with a friends help you can be sure you
                didn't miss any spots.</p>

                <p><strong>NOTE: IF YOU HAVE SHADES 3-4 NATURAL BLACK OR DARK
                BROWN ONLY USE 9% (30vol) PEROXIDE DEVELOPER BECAUSE THIS
                APPLICATION IS ON SCALP. I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING 12% (40vol)
                ON THE SCALP. REMEMBER THIS IS ONLY FOR 100% NATURAL, VIRGIN,
                UN-DYED HAIR. IF YOU HAVE DYED HAIR SHADES 3-4 NATURAL BLACK OR

                <h4>Step 2: Section the hair</h4>

                <p>Firstly section the hair into four parts. Using a pin tale comb 
				divide your hair in two. From the middle of your forehead across the 
				top of the head and down to the nape of the neck. Now you should have 
				two sections like pig
                tails. Next use your pin-tail comb to take a section from the
                crown, down to the ear. Do the same on the other
                side. Now you should have your four sections. Use your plastic
                sectioning clips to hold the hair.</p>

                <h4>Step 3: Take a horizontal slice of hair with the pointed end
                of the tint brush</h4>

                <p>Pick one of the four sections to start on. Start at the
                top and a take horizontal slice of hair use the
                pointed end of your tint brush to help you. Make your slice 
				1-2cm thick, if it's any thicker the bleach won't penetrate.</p>
				
				<img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=

                <h4>Step 4: Apply the bleach to the mid-lengths and ends
                first</h4>

                <p>Hold the slice of hair with your hand flat behind it so there is
                something to paint against. Then take the bleach on your tint
                brush and apply it to the mid-length and end of that slice. Do
                NOT apply the bleach to the scalp or root area yet. Once the
                bleach is on the mid-length and ends of the slice, massage the
                bleach into the hair to help ensure it penetrates and gives you 
				an even cover.</p> 
				
				<p>Be careful not to get the bleach on the scalp or root area yet.</p> 
				
				<p>Flip the bleached sliced of hair out of the way and take another 
				horizontal slice of hair
                directly underneath. Continue to apply the bleach in this method taking
                horizontal slices of hair until you reach the bottom of your
                first section. Pick your next section and repeat this
                process until all four sections have bleach applied to the
                mid-length and ends.</p>

                <h4>Step 5: Work fast but be methodical.</h4>

                <p>The reason we work in four sections and take slices is to
                keep things methodical, this helps to ensure you don't miss any
                spots, and working with hair and bleach can get messy and out
                of control if you don't stick to a pattern. It also helps you
                to get into a rhythm as you apply each slice, this is important
                as a rhythm will help you to work fast, and you will need to be
                quick with your application of the bleach to help ensure even
                development.</p>
				
				<p>Bleach starts to act as soon as at it touches the
                hair, so the first of the four sections you did will be
                slightly ahead in the development compared to the last section
                that you finish on. This is why it is important to work in a
                rhythmic, methodical pattern. There are of course a number of
                different ways to do this application but this is the
                simplest. Remember to massage the bleach into each slice of
                hair as you go. DON'T use a comb on hair with bleach in. You
                will struggle to pull the comb through and the tension it
                causes damage. Gently massaging the bleach into the hair is all you
                need, but don't be rough, you don't want to create knots.</p>

                            <p>Why not apply bleach to the roots first? Because
                            heat speeds up the development of bleach, and your
                            head produces heat. So the bleach on your roots
                            will develop faster then the bleach on the ends of
                            your hair. So to keep development time even we
                            apply the bleach to the roots last.</p>

                <p>Once you have finished applying the bleach to the mid-length
                and ends return to the first section and apply to the roots. Follow the same
                pattern as you did before until all the roots are covered. Now
                the hair should be completely cover with bleach from roots to
                ends. It is important to do the roots last to keep development
                time even, and create an nice even blonde. If we had done it
                the wrong way around you would end up with the roots blonde and
                ready to wash off, but the ends still yellow and needing longer
                to develop. Doing the roots last is key to doing a full head
                bleach and getting an even result.</p>

                <h4>Step 7: Set your timer.</h4>

                <p>Once you have finish set a timer. The development time will
                vary depending on the natural level you started with. Here is a
                guide to help you decide how long to set the timer
                for...</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/Bleach%20Timing%20Guide%20on%20Natural%20Hair.png">

                <h4>Step 8: Cross-check, clip up and clean up.</h4>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/clipupbleach.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>Once the timer is going take a moment to double check your
                work and make sure you have not missed any spots. Because we
                took horizontal slices when applying, the best way to make sure
                everything is covered is to go the opposite way and take
                vertical slices down the hair. This is called cross-checking.
                Once you feel confident everything is well covered with bleach,
                clip the hair up on your head so the bleach does not touch
                your neck. This also keeps the ends closer to your scalp
                near where the heat is. Then take a damp old towel and use it
                to clean up around the hairline, ears, neck and any other areas
                you may have made a mess on. If you like you can also cover
                your hair with an old shower cap. This helps keep dripping and
                mess to a minimum.</p>

                <h4>Step 9: Keep an eye on it.</h4>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/check%20bleach.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>About half way through the development time have a sneak
                peak and see how it's looking. This is a good time to re-apply
                any spots that may look a bit dry or where the bleach may have
                lifted away from the scalp. Some peoples hair will develop
                faster than others. If you have fine hair you may find it
                lightens quicker than someone with thick hair. Keep a close
                eye on it. To check the level of lift simply scrape away the
                bleach and see what the hair underneath looks like. If
                it's still yellow or orange you need longer, re-apply over that
                spot and give it another 5 min. Once the timer goes off check
                it again in the same way. Use your judgement, if you think it
                needs longer set the timer for another 5min. If it is looking
                blonde it's time to shampoo it out.</p>

                <h4>Step 10: Shampoo the bleach off.</h4>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/washoffbleach.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>Once you are happy with level of blonde, it's then time to
                shampoo the bleach off. Don't leave bleach on for more than
                45min maximum. If it still looks yellow after 45min shampoo it
                off anyway.
                When you wash be gentle with your hair, it is still fragile.
                Start by rinsing thoroughly, once most of the bleach is rinsed
                out add shampoo. Use a deep cleanse shampoo and don't
                scrub too hard, your scalp will be sensitive. Be
                thorough, give 2-3 shampoos to ensure all the
                bleach is out. Rinse well, for 3-4min 
                after the last shampoo. If you plan on doing the bright rainbow
                colours straight after DO NOT CONDITION. If you want to
                do the bright colours another day and keep you hair blonde for
                a few days then use conditioner as normal.</p>

                <p>Your hair should feel like straw. But as it says in The
                Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy: "DON'T PANIC". This is how it
                is supposed to feel. In this dry, thirsty state your hair is in
                the perfect condition to suck up and absorb the bright rainbow
                dyes like a sponge. Giving you vibrant and long-lasting
                results. Conditioner would create a barrier causing colours to 
				fade faster.
				The dyes will act like a deep conditioning
                treatment, so by the time you are finished it will feel super
                glossy and healthy again. <img alt="Image" class="floatRight"
                src="images/tangle%20teezer.png">However while it is in this
                pre-lightened state be gentle with it.
                Don't use a comb and tug and tear tangles from your hair.
                Instead use a soft bristled, wide paddle brush, or even better
                a <a onclick="open_in_user_default_browser(this.href); return false;" href="http://www.tangleteezer.com/" target="_blank">Tangle

                the ends of your hair first and slowly work your way up to the
                roots. If you have time, let you hair dry naturally before you
                start the bright colours. If you don't have time and need to
                blow dry, use the low heat setting. </p>

                <p>Your hair will now feel different from it's natural colour, it
                feel feel finer when wet and stiffer when dry. When you blow-dry you may
                find you have more body than before, but it won't have as much
                shine.<img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/SFXTONER.png"> This is the normal feel for bleached hair.
                If you like the colour and want to keep it blonde for a while 
				use a 'Clear' semi-permanent dye.
                This will coat the hair with a clear gloss layer, and put
                the shine back into your hair and help it to feel full and
                glossy again. If you want to keep it blonde but feel it is to
                yellow or golden use a 'Toner' semi-permanent dye for a
                5 minutes. These come with a light blue/purple tone.
                This will help neutralize the warm yellows and give you a nice
                creamy blonde. If you want white hair, use the same 'Toner'
                blue/purple tone dye, and leave it on for longer,
                approximately 30-40min. Bleached hair is always more sensitive
                than natural hair. So be gentle with it. Don't use a comb and
                tug and tear tangles from your hair. Instead use a soft
                bristled, wide paddle brush, or a Tangle Teezer
                (see above). Always brush from the ends of your hair first and
                slowly work your way up to the roots. I also recommend doing
                regular intensive treatments to help keep the condition feeling
                healthy. See the 'Maintenance' section for product

				couldn't get it lighther. </p></li>
				
				<li><p>2. You simply washed the bleach out too soon.</p></li>
				
	<li><p>3. Your hair wasn't all natural as you thought. The
                dye you put in last year was in fact still there. Now you
                have blonde mid-length and roots, but the ends of your hair
                where the old dye was has come out yellow or orange.</p></li>
				
				<li><p>4. The bleach mixture had too much peroxide, was liquid

</ul> 
<br/>


				
                 <p>You now have two options;</p>
				 
				<p><b>Option 1:</b> Make the most of the colour you have and
                use the bright colours anyway. You are however now limited
                as to what colours you can do.
				</p>
				
				<img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src="images/warmcolouroptions.png">
				
				<p><b>Option 2:</b> If none of these are colours you wanted, and you wished
                to do more cooler tones like blues and purples, then your
                second option is to bleach your hair again. If you
                decide you need to do a second bleach, first check the strength
                and condition of your hair to make sure it will cope with a
                second round...</p>

                <h4>How to check the strength and condition of your hair:</h4>

                <p>Take a strand of hair. Hold it between you fingers and pull
                in opposite directions.<img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/elasticity%20test.png"> If the strand breaks easily the
                hair is not strong and you can't put bleach on it again. If the
                strand stretches and is hard to break then the condition and
                strength of the hair is good and you can do a second bleach.
                This is called an 'elasticity test', as it checks the hair's
                ability to stretch. If the hair is damaged and brittle it won't
                be able to stretch and will easily snap. But if the hair is
                strong it will stretch out.</p>

                <h4>How to bleach your hair a second time if the result was
                very yellow or orange after the first bleach.</h4>

                <p>If your hair passed the 'elasticity test' you are good to go
                for another round of bleach. Follow exactly the same
                application method as you did before with just two
                changes...</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mix the bleach powder with just 6% (20vol)
                    peroxide this time.</strong> You don't need it as strong as
                    we only have a little bit more lightening to do this
                    time.<br></li>

                    <li><strong>Don't leave the bleach on for as long.</strong>
                    Between 15 - 30min should be enough. But keep a close eye
                    on it, you may find it goes to that blond stage quite
                    fast.</li>

                <h3>What if my hair is dyed?</h3>

                <p>Dyed hair is always a bit more tricky to work with, it
                doesn't lighten as easily as natural hair. The biggest
                differences with bleaching dyed hair are peroxide levels and
                timing. Also it's important to remember that some dyed hair
                colours will never lighten to pale yellow blonde (Butter
                Blonde). So if the hair is dyed black, darkest plum, dark red
                or dark copper it will only lighten to an orange tone. This is
                fine if you want just bright red or orange hair, but if you
                want rainbow colours the cool tones won't take well over the
                orange base. There are always exceptions to this rule, I have
                in the past taken dyed permanent dark red to up to blonde, but
                it's not easy and I don't recommended you try to do this at
                home. Instead seek professional assistance. However if your
                hair is dyed medium brown or lighter this is what you can do at
                home...</p>

                <h4>How to apply a full head bleach If you hair was dyed less
                than 2-3 weeks ago:</h4>

                <p>Use the peroxide level guide above to see what level you
                should use. Then simply follow the same application method for
                the full head bleach as explained above, starting with the ends
                and finishing with the roots. For timing use this guide to
                determine how long you should set the timer for...</p><img alt=

                <h4>How to apply a full head bleach If you hair was dyed more
                than a month ago:</h4>

                <p>If it has been a while since you had your hair dyed you will
                have your own natural hair in the roots, also know as
                're-growth', and the dye in the mid lengths and ends. This is
                where things get interesting as you now need to consider both
                the natural re-growth and the dyed mid lengths and ends. Again
                this comes down to peroxide levels and timing. You will need to
                follow the same application method for the full head bleach as
                explained above. But the key difference is that you may need to
                allow the bleach to sit on the dyed mid lengths and ends for a
                while before applying to the roots. OR if the dyed hair is
                lighter than your natural roots you may need to apply to the
                roots first. You may also need to mix up two different bowls of
                bleach with different peroxide levels in each, one for the dyed
                part of your hair and another for the natural hair in the
                roots. To work out what levels of peroxide you need, use the
                peroxide level guide above. To work out the timing use the
                guides for both natural and dyed hair. I'm going to give you
                some examples here to help you understand...</p><img alt=

                            <p>If your dyed mid lengths and ends are LIGHTER
                            then your natural roots (like in example 2) it is
                            very possible that the lighter mid lengths and ends
                            may have already been bleached to get it lighter
                            than your natural colour. I would suggest you do
                            both an 'elasticity test' to check the condition
                            and strength of you hair before you bleach. Plus a
                            strand test to see how fast the bleach acts on the
                            lighter mid lengths and ends. If it WAS perviously
                            bleached it may only take 5-10min for it to
                            lighten.</p>

                <p>This is where only an area or 'panel' of the hair is
                bleached, and the rest is left natural. With this technique
                it's all about where you place the panel. For example if you if
                you do the section over where you part your hair it will give
                you a strong visual impact as it is in the most visual area.
                However if you do the bleached panel in the side or through the
                underneath is will be more subtle and less obvious. This
                technique is my personal favourite, as it gives you a lot of
                creative freedom, not just in where you place the panel, but
                also in what shape and size you want to make it.</p>

                <h4>Pros:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>LESS DAMAGING</strong>

                        <p>Because only an area is bleached and the rest left
                        natural the majority of your hair still feels like it's
                        normal self. This is great if you don't like the feel
                        of bleached hair, or if you already have dry/damaged
                        hair and don't want to do a full head bleach.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>LOW MAINTENANCE</strong>

                        <p>If you do your bleached panel in the side or
                        underneath, the roots/re-growth will not be visible.
                        This means you don't have to touch up the roots all the
                        time. You can go months without having to re-bleach the
                        roots. However if you put the panel in the top or
                        parting area, the roots/re-growth will visible and be
                        the same as maintenance as a full head bleach (so every
                        3-4weeks).</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong>MORE AFFORDABLE</strong>

                        <p>Because less hair is being bleached and coloured,
                        you use less product. Also if the panel is underneath
                        you don't have to touch up the roots all the time, so
                        less money is spent on bleach. Finally because the
                        condition of the hair is good less money is spent on
                        treatments, repair products and hair cuts, so all round
                        this is a much cheaper option than a full head
                        bleach.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>UNLIMITED COLOUR OPTIONS</strong>

                        <p>Panel areas can be any shape or size. You could do a
                        big area through all the underneath, a star shape on
                        the crown, a little panel on one side, or even a two
                        long panels like tyre tracks each side on the top, so
                        when you part your hair one side you get one colour and
                        when you flip it the other way you see the second
                        colour. Don't forget you can do multi-coloured
                        rainbows in the bleached panel after. The options are
                        endless, use your imagination and have fun with it.</p>

                        <strong>EASY TO HIDE</strong>

                        <p>If you do the panel area underneath in long hair,
                        you can hide it for work or school by pinning up that
                        area, while leaving the rest down so it is hidden. I
                        call it the 'Vanishing Trick' and I'll show you how to
                        do this in the <a href="#14">'Styling'</a> section.
                        It's harder to hide if you do a panel in the top.</p>

                        <p>This can be an 'Off' scalp application if you don't
                        apply directly to the scalp.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>GOOD FOR DARK OR DYED HAIR</strong>

                        <p>Because this can be an 'Off' scalp application you
                        can use the strongest bleach with 12% (40vol) peroxide.
                        This is great if you have dyed hair or naturally dark
                        hair, and need a strong bleach mix to lighten it.</p>

                <h4>Cons: None</h4><br>

                <h4>How to apply a panel/section of bleach...</h4><br>

                <h4>Step 1: Prepare</h4>

                <p>A panel application can be either 'On' or 'Off' the scalp.
                This is good if you have naturally darker or have dyed hair and
                want to used the stronger 'Off' scalp bleach and a higher level
                of peroxide. However if you are wanting to apply the bleach to
                your scalp be sure only use the 'On' scalp bleach only. Also do
                a skin/patch test first, especially if this is your first time
                applying bleach to your scalp.</p>

                <p>Wear an old T-shirt that you don't mind getting bleach on
                and rubber gloves. Mix up the beach before you start, and
                remember to use the correct type of bleach powder. I suggest
                you start by mixing approximately 10g 'ON-Scalp' bleach powder
                and 20g peroxide developer (you may need more for bigger
                panels). If your chosen panel area is on the back of your head,
                I would advise you get the help of a friend or family member,
                so you can be sure you don't get bleach on the wrong
                parts.</p><img alt="Image" class="floatLeft" src=
                "images/clip%20hair%20panel.png">

                <h4>Step 2: Section the hair</h4>

                <p>Start by sectioning out the panel of hair you wish to
                colour. Use a pin tail comb to help get the section neat, then
                use clips to secure the panel and the hair around the panel to
                keep it out the way while you work. If you have long hair you
                can even tie up the rest of your hair tightly so it's not going
                to fall in your way while you are working.</p>

                <p>The panel you section out to be bleached can be any size,
                shape and in any place you want. But think about how the hair
                falls to help you get an idea of the result you will get. The
                example drawn on the left is a suggestion for a colourful side
                parting or sweeping fringe. The good thing with the location of
                this panel is you can easily swap you parting to the other side
                if you need to hide the bright colours for school or work.</p>

                <h4>Short hair tip:</h4>

                <p>Sectioning short hair can be tricky, so use styling wax or
                paste to stick the hair around the panel down and keep it out
                of the way. This will help you get the section nice and
                neat.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/short%20hair%20panel%20wax.png"><br>
                <br>

                <h4>Step 3: Apply the bleach</h4>

                <p>Start around the outline of the panel, then take horizontal
                sections through it to ensure you don't miss any
                spots.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/short%20hair%20bleach.png">

                <p><strong>Off scalp:</strong> Don't apply the bleach to the
                scalp, go as close as you can without touching it.<br>
                <strong>On scalp:</strong> Apply to the mid-length and ends
                first, then go back through the panel and apply to the
                roots/scalp last.</p>

                <p><strong>EXAMPLE OF OFF SCALP PANEL BLEACH IN LONG
                HAIR:</strong> This panel is in the back underneath layer of
                hair. This makes it easier to pin up the panel of colour and
                hide it for school or work (see styling section). With longer
                hair you need to gently massage the bleach into the mid-length
                and ends of each section in the panel to ensure even coverage.
                But don't be rough, you don't want to create
                knots.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=

                <h4>Step 4: Work fast but be methodical.</h4>

                <p>Exactly the same principles apply to bleaching a panel as
                with the full head bleach:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Make sure you don't miss any spots.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Stick to a methodical pattern, working in horizontal
                        sections.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Get into a rhythm to help you to work fast. This
                        helps the development timing to be even.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>DON'T use a comb on hair with bleach in.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Step 5: Set your timer</h4>

                <p>Once you have finish set a timer on your phone. The
                development time will vary depending on the natural level you
                started with and if you have previously dyed hair or not. Use
                the "Bleach Timing Guide on Natural Hair" and "Bleach Timing
                Guide on Dyed Hair"chart's provide above in the full head
                bleach section to find out how long you will need.</p>

                <h4>Step 8: Cross-check, clean up and clip-up.</h4>

                <p>Once the timer is going take a moment to double check your
                work and make sure you have not missed any spots. Because we
                took horizontal slices when applying, the best way to make sure
                everything is covered is to go the opposite way and take
                vertical slices. This is called cross-checking. Once you feel
                confident everything on the panel is well covered with bleach,
                clip the bleached hair up and out the way, so it doesn't touch
                the hair you left out. This also keeps the ends closer to your
                scalp near where the heat is. Then take a damp old towel and
                use it to clean up. If you like you can also cover the bleached
                panel with some foil. This helps keep dripping and mess to a
                minimum during the development time. It also keeps heat from
                the scalp in for an even development.</p>

                <h4>Step 9: Keep an eye on it.</h4>

                <p>About half way through the development time have a sneak
                peak and see how it's looking. This is a good time to re-apply
                any spots that may look a bit dry or where the bleach may have
                lifted away from the scalp if you did an 'On' scalp bleach.
                Also some peoples hair will develop faster than others. If you
                have fine hair you may find it lightens quicker than someone
                with thick hair. So keep a close eye on it. To check the level
                of lift simply scrape away the bleach and see what the hair
                underneath is looking like. If it's still yellow or orange you
                need longer, re-apply over that spot and give it another 5 min.
                Once the timer goes off check it again in the same way. Use
                your judgement, if you think it needs longer set the timer for
                another 5min. If it is looking blonde it's time to shampoo it
                out.</p>

                <h4>Step 10: Shampoo the bleach off.</h4><img alt="Image"
                class="floatRight" src="images/shampoo.png">

                <p>Once you are happy with level of blonde, it's then time to
                shampoo the bleach off. Don't leave bleach on for more than
                45min maximum. If it still looks yellow after 45min shampoo it
                off anyway. Bleach should not be left on for longer than 45min.
                When you wash be gentle with your hair, it is still sensitive.
                Start by rinsing thoroughly, once most of the bleach is rinsed
                out do your first shampoo. Use a deep cleanse shampoo and don't
                scrub to hard, your scalp and hair will be sensitive. But be
                thorough, I suggest you do 2-3 shampoos to ensure all the
                bleach is out. Rinse well, I suggest a good 3-4min rinse
                after the last shampoo. If you plan on doing the bright rainbow
                colours straight after DO NOT CONDITION. However if you want to
                do the bright colours another day and keep you hair blonde for
                a few days then you may condition your hair as normal.</p>

                <h4>Expected Results</h4><br>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/elliott.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>You should now have a beautiful splash, stripe or chunk of
                blonde hair. The expected results of this bleached panel will
                be the same as explained in the full head section above. So if
                you plan on doing the bright rainbow colours straight after and
                did NOT condition: You hair should feel like straw. Don't
                panic. This is in the perfect condition for the hair to absorb
                the rainbow dyes like a sponge.</p>

                <p>If you wanted it blonde for a while and DID condition: I
                recommend toning or using a 'Clear' semi-permanent dye. This
                will coat the hair with a clear gloss layer, which puts the
                shine back into your hair.</p>

                <p>If the panel looks very yellow or orange: As explained in
                the full head bleach this can be caused by a number of things
                such as...</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your natural hair was shades 3-4 (natural black/dark
                    brown) and you couldn't enough lift with the bleach mix
                    used.</li>

                    <li>The bleach was washed out to soon.</li>

                    <li>Your hair wasn't all natural and the dyed part has come
                    out yellow or orange.</li>

                    <li>The bleach mixture was to drippy and runny and so did
                    not lighten as it should.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/bleach%20panel%20long%20hair%20finshed.png"><br>

                <p>Either way, if it came out yellow or orange you have two
                options: First option is to use the bright colours anyway,
                however you are now limited to only doing dark or warm colours.
                Second option is to bleach your hair a second time. If you
                decide you need to do a second bleach, first check the strength
                and condition of your hair to make sure it will cope with a
                second round. Used the 'elasticity test' explained above to
                test this. If your hair passes the 'elasticity test' you are
                good to go for another round of bleach. Follow exactly the same
                application method as you did before with just two changes:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Mix the bleach powder with just 6% (20vol)
                        peroxide this time.</strong> You don't need it as
                        strong as we only have a little bit more lightening to
                        do this time.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Don't leave the bleach on for as
                        long.</strong> Between 15 - 30min should be enough. But
                        keep a close eye on it, you may find it goes to that
                        blond stage quite fast.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>If you hair is dyed:</h4>

                <p>Please use the timing and peroxide levels guides plus the
                instructions given above in the full head bleach section.
                Simply apply the same guidelines to the panel application
                method.</p>

                <h3>Foiled Streaks.</h3>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/streaks.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>This is where bleach is applied to a small slice of hair on
                a foil. The foiled is then folded together to keep the bleached
                slice of hair separate it from the rest of the hair. The result
                is a small streak of blonde hair, or if you do more than one, a
                few streaks. You can also do foils side by side to make a
                thicker, chunky single streak of blonde. This type of
                application if for people who want something more subtle, and
                less dramatic. It is also great for those who have a sensitive
                scalp as this is 'Off' scalp only application. However there
                are some things you should consider before you do foiled
                streaks...</p>

                <h4>Pros:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>LESS DAMAGING</strong>

                        <p>Because the majority of your is still natural and
                        only small steaks are bleached this is the least
                        damaging application method. This is great if you don't
                        like the feel of bleached hair, or if you already have
                        dry/damaged hair.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>VERY LOW MAINTENANCE</strong>

                        <p>If you do the foiled streaks the sides or
                        underneath, as it grows out the re-growth will not be
                        visible. This means you don't have to touch up the
                        roots all the time. You can go months (up to 6 or 7
                        months) without having to bleach up the re-growth. But
                        even if you put the streaks right over the parting, in
                        the most visible area, the re-growth will still be
                        better than a full head or panel bleach, because the
                        majority of the hair is still your own natural colour.
                        So even if you do foiled streaks in in the most visible
                        area, you would still only need to touch up every 7-8
                        weeks. So this is the most low maintenance of the three
                        basic bleach applications.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>AFFORDABLE</strong>

                        <p>Because less hair is being bleached and coloured,
                        you use less product. Also because you don't have to
                        touch up the re-growth all the time, less money is
                        spent on bleach. Finally because the condition of the
                        hair is good less money is spent on treatments, repair
                        products and hair cuts, so all round this is a much
                        cheaper option.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>EASY TO HIDE</strong>

                        <p>If you do only a few streaks, or one thick streak
                        underneath in long hair, you can hide it for work or
                        school by pinning it up, while leaving the rest down so
                        the bright part is hidden.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>GOOD FOR SENSITIVE SCALPS</strong>

                        <p>This is an 'Off' scalp application, so because the
                        bleach is inside the foil it doesn't touch the scalp.
                        This makes foiled streaks perfect if you have a
                        sensitive scalp and the bleach never touches you
                        skin.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>GOOD FOR DARK OR DYED HAIR</strong>

                        <p>Because this is an 'Off' scalp application you can
                        use the strongest bleach with 12% (40vol) peroxide. This
                        is great if you have dyed hair or naturally dark hair,
                        and need a strong bleach mix to lighten it, but don't
                        want scalp burn.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Cons:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>LIMITED COLOUR OPTIONS:</strong>

                        <p>Foiled streaks have a certain look to them, unlike
                        panels that can be any shape or size, streaks are
                        limited to only one shape and size. The only options
                        you have with foiled streaks is in the number of them,
                        and where they are placed on the head.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>HARD TO HIDE:</strong>

                        <p>If you do a lot of streaks all over the head you
                        will have trouble trying to hide them all. Although a
                        lot less prominent then a full head of colour, you may
                        still need to have a natural coloured wig for some
                        occasions.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>DIFFICULT:</strong>

                        <p>This application is the most difficult to do. It's
                        fiddly and will take patience to get it right. This is
                        why most people will go to the salon to have foils put
                        in their hair. If you have experience colouring you
                        might find this easier. But if it's your first time you
                        might want to do a few practice ones using conditioner
                        instead of bleach, just to get the hang of using foil
                        and working with small slices of hair. If you are
                        doing the back of your head you will need a friend's
                        help, it's impossible to do yourself.</p>

                <h4>How to apply bleach in foils...</h4><br>

                <h4>Step 1: Prepare</h4>

                <p>For this application method you will need, foil, a pin tail
                comb and clips. Prepare the foil by ripping it to approximately
                the same length as your hair or slightly longer. Rip the same
                number of foils as you would like streaks in your hair (so if
                you want 4 streaks, rip 4 foils). Then do a small fold at the
                end of each foil to give you a straight edge.</p>

                <p>Wear an old T-shirt that you don't mind getting bleach on.
                You won't need rubber gloves as you won't be touching the
                bleach, in fact I find they make it difficult to work as this
                is a more fiddly application. Mix up the beach before you
                start. I suggest you start by mixing approximately 10g bleach
                powder and 20g peroxide developer.</p>

                <h4>Step 2: Decide what sections you want the streaks in.</h4>

                <p>Think about how you want to do the sections, and what effect
                you want to create first. The natural texture of your hair,
                whether it is straight or curly, what sort of cut and style you
                have will all effect how the streaks will fall and look.</p>

                <p>Streaks/Foils applied directly to the parting in straight
                hair will look like stripes, and be very defined lines in the
                hair. One in the front can work great to 'frame the face', but
                lots through the parting will look like zebra stripes. For
                slightly softer look try doing the streaks each side of the
                parting instead and try doing them diagonally as well for a
                less stripy look. The lower down your head you put the streaks
                the less obvious they will be. If you do them right underneath
                at the back of your head you will only see the tips of them.
                However if you do a streak on the neck, hairline or behind the
                ears you will see it when you tie your hair up.</p><img alt=

                "images/Head%20sheet%20foil%20on%20parting.png">

                <h4>Step 3: Slice and Secure a foil</h4>

                <p>Sectioning the hair by parting it in half where you want the
                first streak. Use a pin tail comb to help get the part
                straight, then use a clip to secure the hair above to keep it
                out the way while you work.</p>

                <p>Then using the pointy end of the pin tail comb again to take
                a fine slice of hair.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage"
                src="images/take%20a%20fine%20slice%20of%20hair.png">

                <p>The easiest way to do this is by drawing a line with the
                pointy end of the pin tail comb along the scalp, like a pen.
                Then pull the pin tail comb away from the scalp so it separates
                the slice hair from the rest of the hair. As you pull the pin
                tail comb away use your hand to take hold of the slice of hair
                between you fingers. Make sure you don't take the slice to
                thick. You need to be able to see though it. If you can't see
                thought the hair then the slice will be to thick for the bleach
                to penetrate and the result will be patchy.</p>

                <p>Once you have a good size slice of hair held in between you
                fingers you will need to pick up a foil you prepared earlier
                and place it tightly under the slice of hair.</p><img alt=
                "Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/add%20foil%20under%20slice.png">

                <p>I find the best way to do this is by looping the fold you
                made on the edge of the foil over the pointy end of the pin
                tail comb. Then holding the hair in one hand, and the pin tail
                comb with the foil hooked onto it with the other hand, tuck the
                foil under the slice of hair. Use the comb to help you push it
                tight against the scalp under the slice, while holding the
                slice of hair down against the foil so it is secure. Then just
                slide the comb out of the foil.</p>

                <h4>Step 4: Apply the bleach</h4>

                <p>Start by applying the bleach with the brush onto the top of
                the foil, but NOT on the scalp. WARNING: Do NOT apply the
                bleach to the scalp. Leave about a 1-2cm gap from the roots.
                Continue to hold the ends of the slice of hair while you do the
                top as it will stop the foil from sliding around.</p><img alt=
                "Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/apply%20bleach%20to%20foil.png"><br>

                <div class="one-column columns testimony">
                    <div class="clearfix says">
                        <figure class="marginRight">
                            <img alt="Image" src="images/client_image_1.jpg">
                        </figure>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>With this method of bleach application, the
                            bleach is NOT applied to the scalp. The bleach must
                            stay inside the foil only. This is because we want
                            to keep the blonde only on the small slice of hair.
                            If the bleach leaks/bleeds out of the foil the
                            result will be lines and patches on the scalp and
                            root area around the foil. So keeping the bleach
                            only inside the foil is key to this type of
                            application.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Once you have bleach on the top part of the foil it will
                stick the hair to the foil, so now you can let go of the ends
                of the hair. Now place you hand underneath the foil flat like a
                board. Continue to apply the bleach on the foil to the ends.
                Holding you hand behind the foil like this will give you
                something firm and flat to paint against.</p><img alt="Image"
                class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/apply%20bleach%20to%20ends%20in%20foil.png">

                <p>Use the brush to move the hair around on the foil and make
                sure you don't miss any spots. Be careful not to overload the
                hair with bleach, because the bleach will expand inside the
                foil later and if you have to much it will leak out of the foil
                and make a bleached mess on your hair. Again the key with using
                foil is to keep the bleach inside the foil only.</p>

                <h4>Step 5: Fold the foil.</h4>

                <p>Once the bleach is applied to the slice of hair on the foil,
                you will need to fold the foil securely so that it dose not
                slide or move around in the hair.</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/fold%20foil%20in%20half.png">

                <p>Do this by folding the foil in half, then in half again.
                Then fold each side in. I like to use my pin tail comb to
                create a bend in the foil so it folds easily and stays
                neat.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/fold%20each%20side%20of%20foil.png"><br>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/3foils.png">
                </figure><br>

                <p>EXAMPLE: Here is an example of doing three foils back to
                back in the front to create a thick chunky streak of colour in
                the front. You may of course do a many foiled streaks as you
                like and place them where you want.</p>

                <h4>Step 6: Set your timer</h4>

                <p>Once you have finish applying as many foils as you want set
                a timer on your phone. The development time will vary depending
                on the natural level you started with and if you have
                previously dyed hair or not. Use the "Bleach Timing Guide on
                Natural Hair" and "Bleach Timing Guide on Dyed Hair"chart's
                provide above in the full head bleach section to find out how
                long you will need.</p>

                <h4>Step 7: Keep an eye on it.</h4>

                <p>About half way through the development time have a sneak
                peak and see how it's looking. Do this by gently unfolding part
                of the foil to see the hair inside. Some peoples hair will
                develop faster than others. If you have fine hair you may find
                it lightens quicker than someone with thick hair. So keep a
                close eye on it. To check the level of lift simply scrape away
                the bleach and see what the hair underneath is looking like. If
                it's still yellow or orange you need longer, re-apply over that
                spot, and fold the foil back up and give it another 5 min. Once
                the timer goes off check it again in the same way. Use your
                judgement, if you think it needs longer set the timer for
                another 5min. If it is looking blonde it's time to shampoo it
                out.</p>

                <h4>Step 8: Shampoo the bleach off.</h4>

                <p>Once you are happy with level of blonde, it's then time to
                shampoo the bleach off. Don't leave bleach on for more than
                45min maximum. If it still looks yellow after 45min shampoo it
                off anyway. Bleach should not be left on for longer than 45min.
                When you wash be gentle with your hair, it is still
                sensitive.</p>

                <p>Start by unfolding the foils completely and gently pulling
                them out. Don't rip them out while they are still folded, the
                hair is still sensitive and you will cause damage if you are to
                rough. Rinse the hair thoroughly. Once the bleach is rinsed out
                do your first shampoo. Use a deep cleanse shampoo and don't
                scrub to hard, you don't want to create knots and tangles. But
                be thorough, I suggest you do 2-3 shampoos to ensure all the
                bleach is out. Rinse well, I suggest a good 3-4min rinse
                after the last shampoo. If you plan on doing the bright rainbow
                colours straight after DO NOT CONDITION. However if you want to
                do the bright colours another day and keep the blonde streaks
                for a few days then you may condition your hair as normal.</p>

                    <img alt="Image" src="images/foils%20finished%20anya.jpg">
                </figure>

                <h4>EXPECTED RESULTS:</h4>

                <p>You should now have cute little steaks of blonde in your
                hair. Or a one chunky streak if you did the example above of
                doing three foils together. The expected results of the shade
                of blonde are the same as explained in the other bleach
                application methods. So if the steaks came out very yellow or
                orange please refer to the other bleach applications above to
                determine if you will just go on to use the bright colour or if
                you should do a second bleach. If you need to do a second
                application use the pin tail comb to help you pick out the
                yellow or orange steaks and repeat the foil application as
                explained above.</p><br>

                <p>Ok so now we are finally at the fun bit... Colouring time!
                Think back to your old art class, lots of colour, inspiration,
                mess, creativity and fun. The semi-permanent, direct dyes works
                like paint, so think of your pre-lightened hair is the blank
                canvas. It's time to get messy and start painting.</p>

                <p>Doing just one colour is the EASIEST. It requires zero
                skill, only patience. Now you have already done the tricky
                bit of pre-bleaching the hair, so this will be effortless.</p>

                <h3>How does semi-permanent, direct dye work?</h3>

                <p>So as I've explained these semi-permanent, vibrant dyes are
                all synthetic, contain no ammonia and should NEVER be mixed
                with peroxide developer. They work by simply staining the hair
                surface rather then breaking onto the hair like most chemical
                tints/dyes do.</p>

                <p>The hairs surface layer is made up of cuticles, that look
                like fish scales on the hair. These scales can be raise and
                closed, the same way a pine come opens and closes with heat.
                It is these cuticle scales on the surface layer of the hair
                that the dye stains.</p>
                <p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/hair%20cuticle.png">

                <p>Both shampoo and heat lift up the cuticles. Conditioner and
                cold closes the cuticles down flat and smooth. This is why if
                you shampoo only and don't condition the hair feel rough. To
                help the direct dye stain both on-top and underneath the
                cuticles we need to open and lift up the cuticles to help it
                penetrate and absorb on both sides. This is why you shampoo the
                hair only and don't condition before you apply the
                dye.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/hair%20cuticle%20with%20dye.png">

                <p>So as you can see there are no colour molecules being
                removed or added to the inside core of the hair. The dye is
                only staining the outer layer. This is why the dye gradually
                fades as it is washed away with each shampoo, and will go back
                to blonde eventually. This is also why there is zero damage
                with these semi-permanent, direct dyes.</p>

                <p>When you rinse off the dye you don't shampoo. Only
                condition. This closes the cuticles down flat and smooth and
                locks the dye into the surface. Using a cool rinse also helps
                to seal the surface down.</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/hair%20cuticle%20after%20dye.png">

                <p>So then every time you shampoo your hair the cuticles open
                and dye washes out. This is why each time you wash your hair
                you will see colour in the water. With each shampoo the colour
                will gradually fade back to blonde.</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src=
                "images/hair%20cuticle%20dye%20washing%20out.png">

                <p>Some dyes can leave a permanent residue stain in the hair
                even after months of washing. This can happen if you use very
                long lasting dyes such as Special Effects which have a high
                concentration of colour pigments. This can also happen if you
                have been using the same colour repeatedly. Permanent residue
                can't be bleached out so consider this when you pick your dyes.
                You can however still dye over hair that has a permanent
                residue stain. I'll cover this in more detail in the 'Future
                Changes' chapter.</p>

                <h3>How do you apply semi-permanent, direct dye?</h3>

                <p>Just like with bleach there are lots of ways to apply dye in
                your hair to give lots of different looks and effects. I'm
                going to cover the same three basic applications here as I did
                in the 'Safe Pre-Lightening' chapter: Full Head, Panel and
                Streaks. Then we can look into more advanced stuff in the

                <p>1. First pick your colour.</p>

                <p>2. Put on your favorite tunes to listen to while you work
                :)</p><img alt="Image" class="floatLeft" src=
                "images/Pre%20Colour%20Shampoo.png">

                <p></p>

                <p>3. Make sure you hair is freshly washed with a deep
                cleansing, or colour prepare shampoo. DO NOT CONDITION. 
                Then blasted 100% dry with your hairdryer. You don't want any
                moister in your hair or it will dilute the dye. A cheap deep
                cleansing shampoo is perfect to strip the hair of any product
                build up or oil, you want it feeling squeaky clean. A great
                shampoo is LaRiche Directions pre colour shampoo (around £3.80
                GBP/$7 USD) as it is designed to open up the hair cuticle layer
                before you apply semi-permanent, direct dyes. Your hair should
                feel like straw, very dry and crispy. As they say in Hitch
                Hikers' Guide to the Galaxy: 'DON'T PANIC.' <img alt="Image"
                class="floatRight" src="images/anyaclips.png"> This is how your
                hair should be, because washing your hair with the right
                shampoo and no conditioner will leave it porous, like a sponge,
                so it will absorb the dye giving you more intense long lasting
                results. Don't worry the dye you're about to put on is
                extremely conditioning and will make it feel even softer than
                before you bleached it. Trust me.</p>4. Make sure you have
                gloves, hair clips, an old t-shirt and towel you don't mind
                getting covered in dye.
                <p>

                <p>5. If the dye you have picked is very runny it would be a
                good idea to pour it into a tint bowl first and have a brush
                handy. (However squeezing the dye directly from the tube onto
                you hair will save product, and prevent unnecessary wastage).
                This is where I like the pot design packaging where you can
                simply unscrew the lid, dip your bush in and paint. Then when
                your finished just pop the lid back on and save the pot of
                leftover dye for another time.</p>

                <p>6. Gently brush out you hair to make sure it has no knots or
                tangles in while you work. I suggest you use a tangle teezer to
                make light work of the knots.</p>

                <p>7. Apply Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or Barrier cream around
                your hairline, ears, neck... basically anywhere you think your
                going to make a mess.</p>

                <p>8. Make sure you do this in your own home. Speaking from
                experience, if you drip dye on your friends carpet, their mum
                won't let you back in their house for a few years! Make
                sure anything you don't want dye splats on is covered with old
                towels or newspaper. If you have a white shower curtain or
                window curtains, remove them from the work area. Any kind of
                fabric will be stained if you drip, so remove any bath mats or
                rugs. If you are worried about making a mess in a new bathroom,
                and you have an outdoor space and good weather, just grab a
                portable mirror and head outdoors. This will get messy and this
                dye does stain, so be prepared. If you have a ceramic sink,
                bathtub or shower, don't worry about stains, hot water and
                household bleach will clean them off no problem. It's more
                fabrics, carpets, curtains that you should worry about.</p>

                <h3>Full Head One Colour</h3>

                <p>This application if for those who did a full head bleach, or
                those with already naturally blonde or white hair, or those who
                just want to add an all over slight 'tone' to their darker
                hair.</p>

                <h4>Section:</h4>

                <p>Once you have followed the perpetration steps section the
                hair into four sections in the same way we did for the full
                head bleach. Use a pin-tail comb and take a section from the
                front on the hairline straight through the middle to the crown
                and then down the middle of the hair at the back finishing in
                the hairline in back of the neck. Now you should have two
                sections like pig tails. Next use your pin-tail comb to take a
                section from the crown at the top, down to the ear. Do the same
                on the other side. Now you should have your four sections. Use
                your plastic sectioning clips to hold the hair.</p><img alt=
                "Image" class="floatLeft" src=
                "images/dye%20hair%20green%20at%20home.png">

                <h4>Apply to roots:</h4>

                <p>Start by apply the dye to the roots. Be generous. If you are
                to frugal with the dye it can end up patchy. Work in horizontal
                slices down each of the four sections. Being methodical like
                this will make sure you don't miss any spots. You may need a
                friends help with doing the back. Try you best not to get the
                dye on your face, ears or neck, and keep an old towel handy to
                wipe off any drips or mess.</p>

                <h4>Apply to mid lengths and ends:</h4>

                <p>Once you have applied the dye to the roots, check to make
                sure you haven't missed any spots, then go on to apply the dye
                the the mid lengths and ends of your hair. Use the same
                sectioning pattern and take small horizontal slices and apply
                the dye. If you take the slices to thick the dye will not
                penetrate the slice and be patchy. If the dye you are using is
                particularly thick you need to extra careful of this, however
                if the dye is quite runny you will find it much easier to
                spread through.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>WARNING: Do not rub the dye and hair
                            aggressively, as this can change the colour and
                            make it appear lighter where you have rubbed.
                            Instead gently massage and emulsify slowly. This
                            makes sure you get good coverage, without effecting
                            the result.</p>

                </div>

                <h4>Clip, Cover and Clean:</h4>

                <p>Once you have finished, and checked everything, clip your
                hair up so it's not hanging and dipping everywhere. Then wrap
                your head and hair in foil, and then put an old shower cap over
                it all. Yes you will look a bit silly, but it will help stop
                the hair from dripping everywhere, and keep the mess to a
                minimum. So now you can leave the bathroom and go watch TV
                without dye dripping all though the house and running down your
                face. Also the foil helps trap the heat from your head in, and
                heat is perfect to helping hair absorb dye. Plus the foil will
                stop aliens from reading your mind. ;) Don't forget to
                clean your face, ears and neck now your finished.</p>

                <h4>Timing:</h4>

                <p>So with semi-permanent, direct dyes the rule is: "The longer
                you leave it, the longer it lasts." So go read a book, watch a
                movie, play on the internet, update facebook land that your
                sitting with dye on your hair. (But don't say what colour so
                it's a surprise when people see you!)</p>

                <p>However if you are tight for time, have a social life, kids,
                work, and other very important things to do, and can't sit
                around all day with dye on your hair. Give it a minimum of
                45min. To help it to really set in spend 10min of that
                blasting your head with the hairdryer at arms length at full
                heat so the foil, hair and head are all toasty and warm. The
                heat will help open the cuticle layer on the hair and give the
                dye the best chance of absorbing.</p><br>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The longer you leave the semi-permanent, direct
                            dye in, the longer the results will last. Also heat
                            will help the dye to absorb faster.</p>

                </div><img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/shampoo%20green%20hair.png">

                <h4>Rinse:</h4>

                <p>So when your ready to rinse the dye off, make sure you put
                your gloves back on. This is the most messy bit. Use the
                coolest water setting that is comfortable for you. Rinse only.
                DO NOT SHAMPOO. The water won't run clear, but once you feel
                like most of the dye is out, apply conditioner. You can even
                use a conditioning treatment hair mask if you have one and
                leave it for a few minutes before you rise. The combination of
                conditioner and cool water will close down the cuticles and
                help lock the dye into the hair. Do a final rinse, squeeze out
                the excess water, grab your old towel and gently rub and
                squeeze your hair dry. Try not to scrub your hair with the
                towel, this will just create lots of knots.</p>

                <h4>Expected Results:</h4><br>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/green%20hair%20finish.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>So if you had done a full head bleach previously, then the
                dye will give a very true result. You will have a full head of
                shiny, vibrant, bright hair. If your hair was not beached first
                then the result will vary depending on what your hair colour
                was before. If it was dark brown to light brown the result will
                be just a slight hint and shimmer of that tone, and will be
                most visible in direct sunlight.</p>

                <p>If you applied the colour to natural blonde the colour will
                be quite bright, however not as vibrant and true a result as is
                is on bleach hair. The natural warmth in your own blonde hair
                may also effect the result, for example blue will have more of
                a blue/green result, as the yellow in the blonde will make the
                blue appear more blue/green.</p>

                <p>If the hair was natural white (gray) the result will be
                true, but will be less intense and not as vibrant as it would
                be on bleached hair. Some lighter colours will look more pastel
                on natural white hair.</p><br>
                <br>

                <h3>Panel One Colour</h3>

                <p>This application if for those who did a panel bleach or full
                head bleach and want to now add a panel into your now bleach
                blonde hair. Or those with already naturally blonde or white
                hair who want to add a panel of bright colour into it. Although
                you can apply this panel technique to naturally dark hair, the
                slight tone result on the panel is usually lost in dark hair,
                as there is not a significant visible difference between the
                toned panel and the rest of the dark hair.</p>

                <p>Follow all the preparation steps (gloves, hair clips, old
                t-shirt...etc.) explained above.</p>

                <p></p>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src=
                    "images/panel%20section%20for%20colour.jpg">
                </figure>

                <h4>Section:</h4>

                <p>Start by sectioning out the panel of hair you wish to
                colour. If you pre-bleached a panel into your hair you will
                need to section out the bleached blonde hair. Use a pin tail
                comb to help get the section neat, then use clips to secure the
                panel and the hair around the panel to keep it out the way
                while you work. If you have long hair you can even tie up the
                rest of your hair tightly so it's not going to fall in your way
                while you are working. If your pre-bleached a panel is in dark
                hair, you don't have to be to fussy about how neat the section
                is, because if the dye gets onto the darker hair it won't be
                visible. If you have blonde or white natural hair the panel you
                section out can be any size, shape and in any place you want.
                But think about how the hair falls to help you get an idea of
                the result you will get.</p><img alt="Image" class="floatRight"
                src="images/hair%20color%20drawing.png">

                <h4>Apply:</h4>

                <p>Use a brush to apply your chose dye to the sectioned out
                panel of hair. Start around the outline of the panel on the
                roots, and then work in horizontal slices through the panel
                applying to the roots first, then straight thought to the ends.
                Be generous with the dye. If you are to frugal it can end up
                patchy. Be methodical, this will make sure you don't miss any
                spots. You may need a friends help if the panel is on the back
                of your head.</p>

                <p>If the panel is pre-bleached in your naturally dark to light
                brown hair you can be as messy with the dye as you like.
                Because if you drip or paint hair that is not blonde by mistake
                it won't matter as the bright colour won't show up on the
                naturally darker hair.</p>

                <p>However the opposite applies to natural blonde or white
                hair. You need to take extra care not to let the dye touch
                anything except the panel you want coloured. I would suggest
                you use some foil to wrap the dyed panel up in once you have
                finished to help keep it separate from the rest.</p>

                </div>

                <h4>Clip, Cover, Clean and Timing:</h4>

                <p>As explained in the 'One Colour Full Head' application
                above, once you have finished, and checked everything, clip the
                panel of hair up so it's not hanging and dipping everywhere.
                Then wrap the panel of hair in foil, and then put an old shower
                cap over it all. Don't forget to clean your face, ears,
                neck or any other areas you have gotten dye on. As explained
                above, the direct dyes rule is: "The longer you leave it, the
                longer it lasts." Applying heat will help the dye absorb
                better.</p>

                <h4>Rinse:</h4>

                <p>So as I said, if you have the panel in naturally dark to
                light brown hair, you can just rise it easily as you would
                normally. The dye that runs in the water won't have any effect
                on the naturally dark to light brown hair. HOWEVER, if you have
                natural blonde or white hair you will need to be very careful
                not to let the dye and water run into the rest of your natural
                blonde or white hair, because it will leave a pastel tone in
                the rest of your lighter hair.</p>

                    <img alt="Image" src="images/wet%20hair.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>So if your dyed panel is in the front of your natural
                lighter hair, run the water forward and down over your face,
                holding your head forward. Don't rinse the water back into the
                rest of your hair.</p>

                <p>Or, if the dyed panel is in the back of your hair, tie/clip
                as much of the natural lighter hair up and out of the way. Then
                rinse the water backwards, so it runs down your back in the
                shower, and not forward into you natural hair.</p>

                <p>You can also use conditioner and leave it in the rest of
                your lighter hair before you rinse. This will help act as a
                barrier to any splashes that fall into your lighter hair. 
                Of course tie/clip as much of the natural lighter hair out of
                the way to make it easier to only rinse the dyed panel of
                colour.</p>

                <p>As explained in the One Colour Full Head application, when
                you rinse the dye off follow these seven steps:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Put your gloves back on.</li>

                    <li>Use the coolest water setting that is comfortable for
                    you.</li>

                    <li>Rinse only. DO NOT SHAMPOO.</li>

                    <li>The water won't run clear, so just feel to make sure
                    most of the dye is out.</li>

                    <li>Use a conditioner or a conditioning hair mask.</li>

                    <li>Do a final rinse, squeeze out the excess water.</li>

                    <li>Gently rub and squeeze your hair dry. Try not to scrub
                    your hair with the towel, this will just create lots of
                    knots.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <br>

                <h4>Expected Results:</h4>

                <p>Once you have dried off and styled your hair, you should
                have a funky bright panel of colour in your hair. Bellow is an
                example of the result you would get doing one bright colour
                over a pre-lightened panel at the back, bottom layer (as shown
                in the Panel Bleach application method).</p><img alt="Image"

                <h3>FOILED STREAK ONE COLOUR</h3>

                <p>This application if for those who bleached with foil a
                streak(s) of blonde into the natural colour. Or for those who
                did a full head bleach and want to now add a streak(s) of
                colour into your now bleach blonde hair. Also if you have
                already naturally blonde or white hair you can also use this
                application method to add a streak(s) of bright colour into it.
                Although you can apply this foil technique to naturally dark
                hair, the slight tone result is usually lost in dark hair, as
                there is not a significant visible difference between the toned
                streak and the rest of the dark hair.</p>

                <p>Follow all the preparation steps (gloves, hair clips, old
                t-shirt...etc.) explained above.</p>

                <h4>If you bleached streaks into darker to light brown
                hair...</h4>

                <p>You don't need to worry about sectioning out the bleached
                blonde streaks. As I explained before, the dye won't have any
                visible effect on the the naturally dark to light brown parts
                of your hair. You still want to keep the dye to the
                pre-lightened blonde streaks, but you won't need to use foil to
                separate the hair.</p>

                <h4>Sectioning if you have bleached streaks in light
                hair...</h4>

                <p>You will need to use a pin tail comb to pic out the bleached
                streak(s). Use clips to secure the hair you don't want to
                colour out of the way. We will be using foil to apply the
                colour to keep the dyed hair from touching your lighter
                hair.</p>

                <h4>Sectioning if you have all naturally blonde, white hair or
                all bleached hair...</h4>

                <p>If you have natural or bleached blonde hair, or white
                natural hair then you can chose where you want to put the
                streak(s). They can be in any place you want, as you don't have
                to pick out any pre-bleached streaks. But think about how the
                hair falls to help you get an idea of the result you will get.
                We will be using foil to apply the colour to keep the dyed hair
                from touching the rest of the lighter hair.</p>

     
				
                <h4>Apply with foil:</h4>

                <p>So for those who have bleached streaks in light hair, or
                naturally blonde, white hair or all bleached hair, you will
                need to apply the bright colour in foil. You can refer to the
                "foiled streaks" section in the "Safe Pre-Lightening" chapter
                to see how to use foil. I'm just going to do a little recap
                here for you...</p>
				
				<img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/one%20colour%20foil.jpg">


                <ul>
                    <li>Use the pointy end of the pin tail comb to section out
                    the fine slice of hair you wish to streak.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Make sure you don't take the slice to thick.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Take a foil you prepared earlier and place it tightly
                    under the slice of hair.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Use the comb to help you push the foil tight against
                    the scalp.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Hold the slice of hair down against the foil so it is
                    secure.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Apply the bright semi permanent dye with the brush onto
                    the hair on top of the foil.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Don't worry about leaving a gap at the roots, this is
                    not bleach, and won't expand, so go as close to the scalp
                    as you can.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Be generous with the dye.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Use the brush to move the hair around on the foil to
                    work the dye in and prevent missing patches.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Once the dye is applied fold the foil in half, then in
                    half again.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Then fold each side in using the pin tail comb to
                    create a bend in the foil so it folds easily.</li>
                </ul><br>

                <h4>Apply without foil:</h4>

                <p>Apply one colour without foil is the easiest. Simply pick
                out the pre-bleached blonde streaks, it doesn't have to be
                perfect, if you get some darker hairs it won't matter. The dye
                won't have any visible effect on the the naturally dark to
                light brown parts of your hair. Then waring gloves use a brush
                and apply the dye to the blonde steaks. Use your hands to work
                the dye in, but don't rub to much as it can alter the colour if
                you scrub it in aggressively, just a gentle rub will do. Be
                thorough and use plenty of dye to ensure you don't miss any
                spots.</p>

                <h4>Clip, Cover, Clean and Timing:</h4>

                <p>As explained in the previous applications above for panel
                and full head, once you have finished, and checked everything,
                clip the dyed hair up so it's not hanging and dipping
                everywhere. Then wrap then put an old shower cap (or a plastic
                bag) over it all. Don't forget to clean your face, ears,
                neck or any other areas you have gotten dye on. As explained
                above, the direct dyes rule is: "The longer you leave it, the
                longer it lasts." Applying heat will help the dye absorb
                better.</p>

                <h4>Rinse:</h4>

                <p>So as I said, if you have dyed streaks without foil in
                naturally dark to light brown hair, you can just rise it easily
                as you would normally. The dye that runs in the water won't
                have any effect on the naturally dark to light brown hair.</p>

                <p>HOWEVER, if you have natural blonde, bleached or white hair
                with the dye in foils, you will need to be very careful not to
                let the dye and water run into the rest of your natural blonde
                or white hair, because it will leave a pastel tone in the rest
                of your lighter hair.</p>

                <p>So if your foils are in the front of your natural lighter
                hair, tie all the rest of your hair up and out the way. Then
                run the water forward and down over your face, holding your
                head forward. Don't rinse the water back into the rest of your
                hair. Gently pull the foil out one at a time. Rise the dyed
                streaks thoroughly, shampoo and condition the streaks
                separately, again doing your best not to let the water run into
                the rest of your natural lighter hair.</p>

                <p>Or, if the foils are in the back of your hair, tie/clip as
                much of the lighter hair up and out of the way. Then rinse the
                water backwards, so it runs down your back in the shower, and
                not forward into you natural/lighter hair.</p>

                <p>You can also use conditioner and leave it in the rest of
                your lighter hair before you rinse. This will help act as a
                barrier to any splashes that fall into your lighter hair. 
                Of course tie/clip as much of the natural lighter hair out of
                the way to make it easier to only rinse the foils out.</p>

                <p>As explained in the other applications, when you rinse the
                dye off follow these seven steps:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Put your gloves back on.</li>

                    <li>Use the coolest water setting that is comfortable for
                    you.</li>

                    <li><strong>Rinse and DO SHAMPOO.</strong></li>

                    <li>The water won't run clear, so just feel to make sure
                    most of the dye is out.</li>

                    <li>Use a conditioner or a conditioning hair mask.</li>

                    <li>Do a final rinse, squeeze out the excess water.</li>

                    <li>Gently rub and squeeze your hair dry. Try not to scrub
                    your hair with the towel, this will just create lots of
                    knots.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <br>

                <p>When washing out foils from natural blonde, bleached or
                white hair, you will need to use shampoo to wash the streaks
                separately. The reason we need to shampoo the steaks, is so
                that the next time you shampoo all your hair together the
                streaks won't run dye into the rest of your hair.</p>

                            dye even after 2 - 3 shampoos. I suggest sticking
                            to lighter colored streaks to avoid having a pastel
                            tone in the rest of the lighter hair. Colours such
                            as pink, yellow, orange, blue or purple are fine,
                            however reds and greens I find run quite a lot, and
                            don't look so good.</p>

                <h4>Results:</h4>

                <p>Once you have dried off and styled your hair, you should
                have a streak or streaks of bright colour in your hair. Below
                are a few examples of doing one colour in a streak or
                streaks...</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=

                <h4>Notes on the Candy Cane effect:</h4>

                <p>Although this was a wonderful look for Christmas, it was a
                lot of work. I used the application method explained above for
                one colour streaks using foil. The hair was bleached blonde and
                then I applied Crazy Colour "Fire" in foils to create the red
                streaks. I also used a toner: Fudge "Whiter Shade of Pale", on
                the left out bleached blonde hair. That was the easy bit.
                Washing the foils out was another story. Each red streak was
                shampooed 3x individually then conditioned to reduce the chance
                of the white hair being effected. Very fiddly, time consuming
                and difficult even for a professional. The result was awesome,
                but despite my best efforts, when I next needed to wash my
                hair, the red still ran into the white and gave the white a
                slight pale pink tone. For those thinking of trying this for
                Christmas I would suggest spacing the red streaks out a lot,
                leave a lot of white hair. As the red will take over with each
                wash. Alternatively for a much easier festive look, try red and
                green.</p><br>

                </header>

                <p>So by now you should have a good idea on how to do the three
                basic colour applications; Full Head, Panel and Streaks. You
                should also understand about how the bright dyes work when it
                comes to applying on both darker and lighter hair. You
                should know how to use foil and how to rinse out bright colour.
                Although I will re-cap a little in this chapter, I won't go
                into as much detail. So if your not sure about the three basic
                colour applications, please refer back the both the "Safe
                Pre-Lightening" chapter and the "One Colour" chapter above, as
                this chapter will be a bit more advanced.</p>

                <p>Knowing how to do more than one colour in the hair will open
                up endless possible colour combinations. My personal favorite
                is the 'Rainbow Effect', but you don't have to stop there.
                Pinks and blues are a cute combination, 'Fire' hair can be
                created by combing red, orange and yellow streaks, or for a
                glossy 'Aquatic' look use blue, purple and green. For all these
                combinations you will need to put the dye in foil to stop them
                mixing...</p>

                <h4>Prepare:</h4><br>

                <p>First pick your colours. Think about what kind of rainbow
                you want. A lighter, brighter one with Manic panic 'Electric
                Bannana' neon yellow, or a more golden tones like Crazy colour
                'Canary Yellow'. Do you want your blue to be a true blue? Or do
                you want more of a green blue like Affinage Colour Grenades
                'Moody Blue'? Other thing to consider is not to combine your
                light and dark colours to much. I've found when you do a light
                colour, like Directs 'Florescent Glow', next to a dark colour,
                like Special Effects 'Sonic Green', the green will overpower
                the yellow and wash into it with each shampoo turning the
                yellow lime. Instead I suggest sticking light colours together,
                so use Directions 'Spring Green' instead. Or sticking darker
                colours together, so use Fudge Paintbox 'Gold Finger' next to
                the Special Effects 'Sonic Green'. Once you have picked your
                rainbow dye combination, lay it out the the right order to make
                it easy to see what colour your on next when your dyeing.</p>

                <p>Have lots of brushes. Otherwise you to have to wash the one
                brush each time you swap colour.</p>

                <p>Put on your favorite tunes to listen to while you work
                :)</p>

                <p>Make sure you have gloves, hair clips, an old t-shirt and
                towel you don't mind getting covered in dye.</p>

                <p>If the dye you have picked is very runny it would be a good
                idea to pour it into a tint bowl first and have a brush handy.
                (However squeezing the dye directly from the tube onto you hair
                will save product, and prevent unnecessary wastage). This is
                where I like the pot design packaging where you can simply
                unscrew the lid, dip your bush in and paint. Then when your
                finished just pop the lid back on and save the pot of leftover
                dye for another time.</p>

                <p>Make sure you hair is freshly washed with a deep cleansing,
                or colour prepare shampoo. DO NOT CONDITION. Then blasted
                100% dry with your hairdryer. You don't want any moister in
                your hair or it will dilute the dye. (Refer back the 'Prepare'
                part of the 'One colour' chapter above fore more details on
                what shampoo to use.)</p>

                <p>Apply Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or Barrier cream around
                your hairline, ears, neck... basically anywhere you think your
                going to make a mess.</p>

                <h3>HOW TO DYE RAINBOW PANELS...</h3>

                <p>So this is for those who want a panel of rainbow hair. This
                is my personal favorite, as it is visually striking, but
                doesn't require a full head bleach, so is less damaging. A
                rainbow panel is a great feature piece. The hair will need be
                to be pre bleached in the chosen panel first.</p><br>
                <br>

                <h3>Rainbow Panel over parting or in side fringe</h3><br>
                <img alt="Image" class="floatLeft" src=
                "images/clip%20hair%20panel.png"> <img alt="Image" class=
                "floatRight" src="images/section%20hair%20for%20rainbow.png">

                <h4>Section:</h4>

                <p>Start by sectioning out the panel of pre-bleached hair. Use
                a pin tail comb to help get the section neat, then use clips to
                secure the panel and the hair around the panel to keep it out
                the way while you work. If you have long hair you can even tie
                up the rest of your hair tightly so it's not going to fall in
                your way while you are working. It doesn't matter too much if
                you get colour on the rest of your hair, if your pre bleached
                panel is in light brown hair or darker, but it makes it easier
                to work with. I would suggest doing this in front of a
                mirror if you are doing it yourself.</p>

                <p>Then, using a pin-tail comb to take a small slice of the
                bleached area. Don't make the slice/streak too thick as the dye
                won't penetrate a thick slice. Then clip the rest of the hair
                out the way.</p>

                <h4>Foil:</h4>

                <p>Place a strip of foil under the slice/streak and secure
                using a finger and thumb at the top of the foil. Pull the
                bleached slice of hair to ensure the foil is tightly secured at
                the root.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/drawing%20foil%20slice.png">

                <h4>Apply:</h4>

                <p>Using your free hand, paint the first colour down the foil
                on the section of hair. If you are doing a classic rainbow I
                would start with red. Or if you are doing a reverse rainbow you
                can start with purple. Paint the dye right down to the scalp to
                ensure you don't have any random blonde roots. Use the brush to
                work the dye in on the foil so that there are no missed
                patches.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/drawingpaintingdyeonfoil.png">

                <h4>Fold:</h4>

                <p>Once the colour has been applied, fold the foil in half,
                sticking the dyed hair together. Then use a pin tail comb to
                fold the sides of the foil securely so that it dose not slide
                or move around in the hair.</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/drawingfoilfolded.png"><br>
                <br>
                <img alt="Image" class="floatLeft" src=
                "images/drawingrainbowsection.png"><br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h4>Repeat:</h4>

                <p>Now simply repeat this process, changing the colours you put
                in the foil. Working your way back through the bleached section
                of hair. For thick slices of colour, do 2 foils of the same
                colour next to each other. I'd suggest this for the rainbow.
                Follow the sectioning patter here to get the colours in the
                right order.</p>

                    <img alt="Image" src="images/rinserainbow.jpg">
                </figure><br>

                <h4>Rinse:</h4>

                <p>Rinsing out is the hardest part, as you don't want the
                colours to run together. So be patient and take your time.
                Might be a good idea to get a friend to help.</p>

                <p>Remove each foil one by one and rinse each streak thoroughly
                before taking out the next foil. I'd suggest leaving the foils
                with yellow in till last, because it is the lightest colour
                it's best to leave it in till the other colour are well rinsed.
                This will help prevent the yellow from taking on any of the
                other colours.</p><br>
                <br>

                <h4>Result:</h4>

                <p>Blowdry off and style as normal, and you should have a
                fabulous rainbow panel through the top of your hair. Here are a
                few examples of the results...</p>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/rainbowpanel.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>So now you understand how to use foils to separate the
                colours, let me give you a few sectioning patterns for other
                rainbow panels and effects...</p>

                <h3>Rainbow in hidden back panel underneath</h3>

                <p>This is where a panel at the back of the head is dyed using
                foil in rainbow colours. The great thing about dying this panel
                is that you can easy hide it for things like work, school,
                interviews or weddings. Check out the 'Styling' chapter for
                'The vanishing trick' so see how you hide this kind of
                colour.</p><img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/panel%20section%20for%20colour.png">

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/heathrrainbbow.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>On the flip side it is just as easy to show it off, simply
                tie up the top half of you hair for a beautiful bright flash of
                rainbow colour when you spin around! The only thing with this
                panel being in the back of your hair, is that you will need a
                friends help, it will be impossible for you to do this
                yourself. This example is done in blonde hair but if you have
                dark hair you will need to bleach up this panel in the back
                first, see the 'Safe Pre-Lightening' chapter for details.</p>

                <h4>Key differences:</h4><br>

                <p>1. The foils are applied vertically. This can be quite
                tricky, I suggest you keep your head tilted forward looking the
                floor to make this easier for whoever you will be applying the
                foils. Also you may find it easier to clip each slice of hair
                before you start. This way the vertical sections for each
                colour are all clearly separated and spaced evenly before you
                start applying dye.</p>

                <p>2. The slice/streak sections are quite thick. This means you
                need to ensure the dye covers right through. The way I did this
                was by applying the dye to the root/scalp area of each section
                first, splinting the slice in half to ensure the dye was
                covering all the roots of that section of colour. Then taking a
                foil and placing the remaining mid-length and ends onto it and
                applying the the dye with a brush against the foil (as
                explained above).</p>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src=
                    "images/Photorainbowbackpanelinfoil.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>Don't forget to be generous with the dye and to use the
                brush to work it in on the foil. As this is a thicker section
                of hair you will need to be very thorough. You can check the
                middle of the slice by pushing the hair around on the foil,
                this just ensures the dye has penetrated the slice of hair.
                Fold the foil as explained above and then move of the the next
                slice and colour.</p>

                <h4>Sectioning pattern for hidden rainbow back
                panel:</h4><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/sectionrainbowbackpanel.png">

                <h4>Results:</h4><br>

                <p>There are lots of ways to style this kind of colour, even
                just tying it all up will show it off. I particularly love how
                rainbow hair looks braided. Here are a few examples of results
                for the rainbow back panel...</p>

                <figure class="marginRight">

                <h3>Square rainbow panel in short hair.</h3><br>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/jennybleachpanel.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>This is great for those with short hair who like to style it
                up at the front. Or even those with longer hair, who like to
                tie there hair back off there face all the time. This is very
                similar to the rainbow panel over parting or in side fringe,
                but with just a few differences.</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "floatRight" src="images/jennypanelpins.jpg">

                <p>The example here is done in white gray hair, however the
                hair was still bleached in the panel where the rainbow will be
                so as to help the dye absorb better and last longer (See
                'Lightening Products' chapter for details).</p>

                <p>Once the panel is pre-lightened we section out each slice
                that would be a different colour and pined them. This helps to
                ensure even spacing of the colour.</p>

                <p>The foils are applied vertically. This is much easier to do
                on top of the head than it is at the back as shown in the last
                colour pattern. For short hair you will also need to use
                shorter foil. If your hair is curly, or difficult to work with,
                use styling paste or wax to stick down the hair around the
                section that you don't want dyed.</p>

                <p>When rinsing, take each foil out one at a time and rinse
                that colour before moving to the next foil. If you have light
                hair run the water forward over your face, not back into the
                rest of your hair.</p>

                <h3>FULL HEAD Double RAINBOW</h3>

                <p>For this you will need to have done a full head bleach or
                have all naturally very light blonde or white hair. In the same
                way panel multicolour can be done in any number of sectioning
                patters and designs, so can full head colours. If you are doing
                very large sections you can simply use clips to separate the
                colours (same as panel oe colour). However if you are doing
                lots of colours in small pieces you will still need to use foil
                to separate the colours...</p>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/fullheadrainbowfoils.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>This is VERY time consuming, but looks insane. Give yourself
                a good 3-4 hours and you will need extra help with the back.
                This is best suited to layered hair so you can appreciate all
                the colours. To help reduce time, the sections are taken a
                little thicker and foil is not foiled in packets (as shown
                previously) but simply folded in half. You are just using the
                foil to keep each colour separate.</p>

                <p>Because the sections are thicker than normal foil sections,
                it's better to apply the colour to the root of the section
                before placing the section into a foil. This ensures the dye
                penetrates the hair and gives good coverage. Apply the dye
                liberally with each section and work it in on the foil to help
                make sure you don't miss any spots before folding the foil.</p>

                <p>With this full head pattern we have a double rainbow. First
                rainbow in the top and sides running from purple at the front
                hairline to orange, red and pink at the crown. The second
                rainbow is at the back, starting from the hairline at the neck
                with red and finishing with purple and pink on the crown (meets
                the first rainbow).</p>

                <p>Ombre means a blend or gradient of colour. It's a popular
                trend at the moment in fashion as well as hair colour, and it's
                very simple to do.</p>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/ombre.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p><strong>1. Section:</strong> If you are doing a streak or
                panel of hair, use you tail comb to section out a slice of
                pre-bleached hair to start on.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Apply 1st colour:</strong> Hold a piece of foil
                under the hair, then apply your first colour to the roots as you
                would normally when applying colour in foil. (NOTE: Remember to
                take the colour right to the scalp to ensure you don't have any
                random blonde roots, but don't apply it on the ends.)</p>

                <p><strong>3. Apply 2nd colour:</strong> Then take the second
                colour that you wish to use, normally a lighter one, and apply
                it to the ends.</p><img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/foils_stacked.jpg">

                <p><strong>4. Blend:</strong> Where the two colours meet take a
                clean brush and use it to blend them together. Use long strokes
                to create a very gradual gradient, or small dabs of the brush
                for more defined band of colour change. What you see on the
                foil is what you will get as the finished result.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Cover:</strong> DON'T fold the foil, simply take
                a new piece of foil and place it over the top. This will keep
                all the blending work in place.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Repeat:</strong> Then take the next section of hair
                and using the foil you just placed over the last colour as the
                base foil start applying the colours in the same way. This is
                using the foil stacking method. So once you finished you should
                have a stack of foils in your hair, with a section of dyed hair
                sandwiched between each foil.</p>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/ombre_fin.jpg">
                </figure>

                <h4>What if the blended part is higher on one foil and lower in
                another?</h4>

                <p>It doesn't matter if the colour change point is higher or
                lower on each section you colour, as it all adds to the ombre
                effect by not being a uniformed line in the hair.</p>

                <h4>Variations:</h4>

                <p>The sky is the limit with the colour blending/ombre
                technique. If you have longer hair you can do a lot more than
                just two colours, try four or five different colours on one
                foil. You can even blend a rainbow if your hair is long
                enough.</p>

                <p>Also you can change the order and combination you place on
                each foil, this will create a tie dye effect. For example: If
                my first foil had pink blending to yellow, my next foil could
                be yellow blending into blue.</p><img alt="Image" class=

                    <h2>Mixing Shades</h2>
                </header>

                <p>Mixing your own shades is great fun, and with the
                semi-permanent brands (like Manic Panic or Special Effects), it
                follows much the same rules as mixing up paint. So let me take
                you back to art class and cover the basics so that you can
                understand how colour works and how to mix up your own unique
                shades.</p>

                <h3>THE COLOUR WHEEL:</h3><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/colourwheel.png"><br>

                <h3>How to make a rainbow with just three colours.</h3>

                <p>Primary colours are the most important colours when it comes
                to mixing. The primary colours are RED, YELLOW and BLUE. With
                these three colours you can mix all other colours. Also these
                three colours can not be mixed or formed by any combination of
                other colours. All other colours are derived from these three
                hues.</p>

                <h4>To make a rainbow with these three primary colours this is
                what you mix...</h4><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/primarymix.png"><br>

                <h4>Now you have a classic rainbow...</h4><img alt="Image"
                class="centeredImage" src="images/basicrainbow.png"><br>

                <p>Mixing colours like this will take time and practice, but if
                you have all day you can even mix up the tertiary colours and
                make a totally mad twelve tone rainbow. WARNING: This will take
                a lot of time and patience, not just to mix, but also to apply
                twelve colours to your hair.</p><br>

                <h4>How to mix a twelve tone rainbow with tertiary
                colours:</h4><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/secondarymix.png"><br>

                <h4>Now you have a twelve tone rainbow:</h4><img alt="Image"
                class="centeredImage" src="images/12rainbow.png"><br>

                <h3>What are "Complementary" colours?</h3>

                <p>Complimentary colour are colours that sit opposite each
                other in the colour wheel. They are "complimentary" because
                when they sit next to each other they create a striking
                contrast to the eye. If you want ideas for two tone colour
                combinations, then using complimentary colours is a great
                idea.</p>

                <h4>Here are a few examples of complimentary
                colours...</h4><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/complimentary.png"><br>

                <h3>What happens when you mix "Complimentary" colours?</h3>

                <p>When you mix two colours that sit opposite each other in the
                colour wheel they cancel each other out and become neutral.
                Neutral means without colour. Depending on how light or dark
                the colours you mix are you will get different neutral shades.
                For example; brown, beige, tan, cream. So when mixing two deep,
                vibrant complimentary colours they create neutral brown.</p>

                <h4>Here are examples of complimentary colours
                mixed...</h4><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/neutral%20mix.png"><br>

                <h3>How do I mix pastel shades? I've heard people say you mix
                the dye with conditioner or peroxide, does that work?</h3>

                <p>Never mix the bright semi-permanent direct dyes with
                peroxide. It just causes unnecessary damage to the hair, and
                there are much better ways to dilute the dye with zero
                damage</p>
				
				<h4>Dirt-cheap way to mix pastel shades:</h4>

                <p>Mixing dye with conditioner works great, but fades fast.
                This is because the conditioner closes the hairs cuticles, the
                dye is not absorbed and so washes out quickly.
                No problem if you only want the pastel colour for a week or so. 
				This is also the cheapest way to do
                pastel tones as you can use any dirt-cheap supermarket conditioner and it
                still works.</p>

                <h4>However when I do pastel colours this is what I like to
                do:</h4>

                <p>Firstly if the pastel colour I want already exists in a
                brand I will use that straight. For example if I want a pale
                pink I would use Manic Panic 'Cotton Candy' pink. It is better
                to use a dye as it is rather that dilute it as the colour will
                last longer this way. However if I can't find the shade I want
                and need to mix up my own pastel colour, I will take my normal
                deep vibrant colour and mix it with a mixer shade (also called: 
				white, clear, platinum or toner). For
                example you can mix Manic Panic 'Hot Hot' pink with Manic Panic 
				'Mixer/Pastel-izer' to create your own pastel pink.</p><img alt=
                "Image" class="centeredImage" src="images/pastlelmix.png">

                <p>Again this will last longer. When mixing pastel tones I
                suggest you play it safe and put the white/toner shade in a
                bowl first and the add drop by drop of the deep vibrant colour.
                That way you can see exactly what colour you are getting and
                stop adding the deep vibrant colour when you are happy with the
                shade. Where as if you simply mix half and half you might think
                it is to bright for your taste and have to add lot's more
                white/toner shade to get it lighter, wasting lots of
                product.</p>

                <h4>A few extra tips for pastel colours:</h4><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Don't rub the dye into the hair, simply paint
                    on. I find when pale colour dye is emulsified it doesn't
                    take as well.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Don't leave in for ages, 30min is normally fine.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>If colour comes out to deep or vibrant for your taste
                    simply give is a few shampoos with deep cleanse or
                    anti-dandruff shampoo to lighten.</li>
					<br/>
                    <li>Pastel colour will always fade much faster than your
                    normal deep vibrant colour. So if you want too keep the
                    colours longer wash with water less often, and use a dry
                    shampoo in between.</li>
					<br/>
					<li>If you have one pastel colour all over, a great way to
					 maintain the colour is to mix that shade up with conditioner.
					  (As explained above you can use conditioner to dilute the 
					  colour to create a pastel tone.) Then use this as your normal
					   conditioner each time you shampoo for a colour top-up. You 
					   can make the mix as intense or as pastel as you like, but use 
					   gloves if you mix a more intense colour conditioner.</li>
                </ul><br>

                <p>Another option to created to pastel effect in a super fast,
                quick, easy way that requires no mixing at all is the two
                minute 'apply and rise' application method...</p>

                    <li>Shampoo hair with deep cleanse or pre-colour
                    shampoo.</li>

                    <li>Don't condition.</li>

                    <li>Squeeze water out of hair, but don't towel dry.</li>

                    <li>Keep shower running.</li>

                    <li>Wearing gloves, take chosen dye, undiluted, straight
                    from the bottle.</li>

                    <li>Pick out the hair/ends/section you want pastel tone on
                    and apply the dye.</li>

                    <li>Quickly rub the dye into the hair, then immediately
                    rinse off in the shower.</li>

                    <li>Once dye in rinsed out, condition hair as normal.</li>

                    <li>Blow-dry and style as normal.</li>
                </ol><br>

                <p>For stronger pastel tone repeat steps 6 and 7 until desired
                shade is reached before applying conditioner. For super subtle
                hint of pastel tone, condition first then do steps 6 and 7.</p>

                <p>Colours normally fade out in 3-4 washes (depending on dye
                used).</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=

                <p>I mixed the high pigment, strong brand (Special Effects)
                with the weaker, low concentration brand Rusk, to help reduce
                the intensity, and create a softer tone. Applied to highlighted

				<h3>BLACK MAGIC</h3>
				<img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/blackdye.png">
				<h4>How to magically turn black dye into blue:</h4>
				<br/>
				
				<p>So black is made up of all three of the primary colours; blue, red and yellow. However of the three colours, black is mostly made up of blue. So an interesting thing happens when you pastelize  black by mixing it with conditioner or mixer/pastel-izer... it turns blue!</p>

				<p>I've found some blacks (such as Directions Ebony) have a slight teal (green blue) tone when lightened, where as 'blue blacks' (Adore or 'N Rage) give a more true blue.</p>

				<p>You can even make a pastel blue by mixing only a tiny spec of black with a LOT of conditioner (because you need so much to dilute the black, a mixer/pastel-izer dye is not cost effective.) This is a great way to do a super cheap pastel blue, as one bottle of black would last years. </p>

                <h3>How do I shampoo rainbow hair without the colours bleeding
                and mixing?</h3>

                <p>You don't have to worry if you have the actual rainbow
                combination of colours, (e.g., red, orange, yellow, green,
                blue, purple) you can just wash your hair as normal. The reason
                for this is that in a rainbow combination each colour makes the
                colour next to it. So even if you do get a little
                bleeding/mixing it really makes no difference to the effect of
                the rainbow. If anything it helps make the rainbow less
                'streaky' and more blended. But I think you will be surprised
                by how little it mixes.</p>

                <p>Even if your hair is not the full rainbow combination, but
                different combination (for example, pink, yellow, turquoise)
                you still don't need to worry about the colours mixing. Just
                wash you hair as normal. There are only a few exceptions when
                the colours would bleed/mix...</p>

                <h3>So what colour combinations will mix when I shampoo?</h3>

                <p>The only time you need to be careful when you shampoo is if
                you have dyed a dark colour next to a light colour. For
                example; if you had midnight blue next to neon yellow, then
                when you washed your hair the yellow would become more lime as
                the blue washes into it (Blue + Yellow = Green). This is
                because darker colours are very high in pigment. However if you
                have a combination of all darker colours it is fine to shampoo
                as normal. For example; if you had midnight blue, blood red and
                pine green, the colours would not effect each other.</p>

                <p>The worst case for colours mixing is when you have a dark
                colour in blonde hair. For example; if you had a blood red
                streak in blond hair, it would give the blond hair a pink tone
                when you shampoo. This is because blonde is the lightest shade,
                and also the most absorbent/porous because it has no
                tone/colour pigments in it. So when you wash it the red will
                absorb into it making it go pink. Particularly if it is bleach
                blonde hair and is dry/damaged, it will act like a sponge and
                just grab onto the red dye.</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/red%20streaks%20shampoo.png"><br>

                <p>In this case for the first 2-3 shampoos I would just be that
                bit more careful and try to wash the darker colours separately
                from the lighter hair as best as possible. Use hair clips to
                help separate your hair, and use lots of conditioner to act as
                a barrier on the lighter hair when you are washing the coloured
                part. However if you don't want any mixing when you shampoo, I
                suggest you simply don't dye your hair with light colours and
                dark together in the first place. Because no matter how careful
                you are, some mixing is inevitable.</p>.

                <h3>How often should I re-bleach and colour?</h3>

                <p>This depends on a two factors: re-growth/roots and colour
                fade. Let me give you some examples...</p>

                <h4>Example 1: Streaks scattered though the sides/back and a
                permanent/long lasting colour used.</h4>

                <p>You could go 3-4 months before you need to touch up. Because
                the majority of the hair is your own natural colour and the
                re-growth/roots is all hidden underneath you don't need to
                touch up your roots all the time. With a permanent or long
                lasting colour the fade won't be as bad as a 4-6 weeks semi
                permanent. You might even like the softer colour and with it
                grown out it will look more like a balayage colour effect. With
                the re-growth/roots hidden underneath you may not even need to
                re-bleach, but simply touch up the bright colour if you prefer
                the vibrant colour to the faded/softer look.</p>

                <h4>Example 2: Full head bleached and a semi permanent bright
                colour used.</h4>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/bleach_regrowth.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>You will need to re-bleach your roots every 4-6 weeks on
                naturally medium brown or lighter hair. 3-4 weeks on dark
                brown hair. Even if your colour fade isn't to bad, or you like
                the pastel colours, I would still recommend you re-bleach the
                roots in this time frame. The reason for this is called 'gold
                colour band'.</p>

                <p>Gold colour band's happen when the re-growth/roots have been
                left to long and are to big. Bleach applied to a large
                re-growth will develop well where the heat from the scalp
                speeds up the processes. However where the re-growth is to long
                to be affected by the scalp's heat it will develop at a slower
                rate, creating a 'gold colour band'. The lighter your natural
                base colour is the less you need to worry, but on dark brown
                hair that throws the most warmth when bleached, a root bleach's
                should be 3-4 weeks to avoid a gold colour band. Gold colour
                band's are less of a worry if you plan on covering then with a
                dark colour (e.g. pine green) or a warm colour (e.g. yellow,
                orange or red) as these will cover and hide it. However colours
                such as sky blue, lilac or candy floss pink won't cover a gold
                band.</p>

                <h4>Example 3: Panel bleach in back underneath and a semi
                permanent bright colour used.</h4>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/panel%20roots.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>You could go 4-6 weeks before you need to colour. With the
                re-growth/roots hidden underneath you don't need to re-bleach
                often. What you will find is the colour will have faded before
                you need to attend to the roots. Depending on the brand used
                and how often you wash your hair you will probably have pastel
                hair by 4-6 weeks and want to brighten it up.</p>

                <p>In this case you don't need to bleach at all, but just
                re-apply the semi permanent dye. If you don't like
                re-growth/roots showing when you tie your hair up you could
                bleach the roots at this time. However I have found re-applying
                the semi permanent dye only can be enough to blend the
                re-growth and brighten things up enough to feel better and not
                need to fuss with the roots. It's you choice, but I would leave
                this kind of colour 4 months before bleaching the roots.</p>

                <h3>Do I need to re-bleach all my hair every time I
                colour?</h3>

                <p>No! Absolutely not.</p>

                <p>This I something I've heard some people say in YouTube
                tutorials and hair blogs and it's total rubbish. Bleaching hair
                that has already been beached <strong><em>WON'T</em></strong>
                help the colour be brighter or last longer, it will only cause
                unnecessary damage to hair that is already sensitized. If
                anything colour will fade faster on over bleached damaged
                hair.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/hairdiagram8.png">

                <p>When hair is damaged by over bleaching the cuticle layer
                (outer scaly layer) is the first part to be eaten away by the
                bleach. This is the layer that the dye needs to stain, so if it
                is to damaged there is nothing for the dye to hold on to.
                Sometimes even after dyeing very bleach damaged hair with a
                semi permanent direct dye (such as Manic Panic), after rinsing
                the dye out the result looks faded, dull and washes out in a
                few shampoos. This is because the dye has not got enough of the
                broken cuticle layer to stain and hold on to.</p><img alt=
                "Image" class="centeredImage" src="images/hairdiagram9.png">

                <p>So when your re-bleach the roots, be careful to only apply
                bleach to the natural new hair, and not to get it on the
                already bleached and coloured hair.</p>

                <h3>What about when I want to change colour?</h3>

                <p>Please read the 'Future Changes' chapter to see how this is
                done.</p>

                <h3>How do I Apply bleach to the re-growth/roots only?</h3>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/bleach_regrowth_1.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>Use the same application method you used the first time, but
                only apply the bleach to the re-growth. For example...</p>

                <h4>Example 1: Full head root bleach.</h4>

                <p>Follow the same sectioning pattern explained in the 'Safe
                Pre-lightening' chapter, using ON scalp bleach apply to the
                roots only. Following the timing guide for natural hair, as the
                roots are all you own natural colour.</p>

                <h4>Example 2: Panel root bleach.</h4>

                <p>Section out the same panel you bleached the last time and
                using ON scalp bleach apply to the roots only. Following the
                timing guide for natural hair, as the roots are all you own
                natural colour.</p>

                <h4>Example 3: Foiled streaks root bleach.</h4>

                <p>This is the hardest to do as you will need to use a pin tail
                comb to pick out the streaks from the last time. Thicker
                streaks are always the easier to find again. Use the same
                application method with foil. You can use both ON and OFF scalp
                bleach as the bleach will not be applied directly to the scalp.
                Paint the bleach onto the re-growth only, but remember to leave
                some space at the very root, as you don't want the bleach to
                leak out of the foil. If the hair is short you can fold the
                foil as normal. But if the hair is long you will need to push
                the coloured ends off the edge of the foil before you fold it.
                This will stop the coloured hair from being foiled into the
                bleach. Your finished foil packet should have a 'tail' of
                coloured hair hanging out of it.</p>

                vibrant for longer and help minimize colour fade...</p>

                    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">10 TIPS FOR LONGER
                    LASTING COLOUR:</h3>

                    <h4>1. Try not to wash your hair to much.</h4>

                    <p>Water and shampoo are what remove the semi-permanent
                    dye. So the more often you shampoo, the faster your colour
                    will fade.</p>

                    <h4>2. Use a 'Dry Shampoo'.</h4>

                    <p>The best way to reduce the amount you wash you hair is
                    by using a 'Dry Shampoo' to help absorb the excesses oil
                    form the scalp. This can give your hair a few extra days
                    before you need to wash it again. This is particularity
                    good if you find your hair is very oily and you normally
                    need to wash it every day.</p>

                    <h4>3. Use cooler water when you shampoo.</h4>

                    <p>As you know, heat lifts up the cuticle's of the outer
                    layer of the hair. This means if you take nice hot steaming
                    showers when you shampoo, the colour pigments under the
                    cuticle's can be rinsed away by the hot water. However if
                    you use cooler water (the cooler the better) the cuticle's
                    stay locked down and the much fewer colour pigments are
                    pulled out by the water. You'll be amazing by how much
                    longer the colour can last using this one trick alone.</p>

                    <h4>4. Add some dye.</h4>

                    <p>You can add a bit of dye in with your shampoo and
                    conditioner to help the colour last longer. (NOTE: This
                    only works if you dyed you hair just one shade, obviously
                    wouldn't work if you did rainbow hair.)</p>

                    <h4>5. Don't get your hair wet if you don't have to.</h4>

                    <p>If you are taking a shower and don't plan on washing
                    your hair then tie it up on top of your head or wear a
                    shower cap. Having the shower water run through your hair
                    will pull the colour out, so you don't want to wet it
                    unless you have to. Also when you DO plan on shampooing,
                    the less time it's under the water the better. Again tie it
                    up on top of your head or wear a shower cap so it doesn't
                    get wet, take you shower (you can have a nice hot shower
                    this way) and when your finished, then flip the water to
                    cool and shampoo your hair as the last thing. This way the
                    colour isn't pulled out in the water during the entire time
                    you are in the shower, plus you can have a nice hot show
                    and not stress about losing the colour.</p>

                    <h4>6. Avoid certain shampoos.</h4>

                    <p>Don't use Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Deep Cleansing and Baby
                    Shampoo as they strip colour the most.</p>

                    <h4>7. Avoid swimming for first 2 weeks after
                    colouring.</h4>

                    <p>Dye will bleed/run in water when it's freshly done.
                    Chlorinated pools can also cause hair to change colour and
                    fade. (If you dyed your hair red you may cause alarm,
                    as people might mistake you for having heavy bleeding from
                    the head!)</p>

                    <h4>8. When you do swim try not to get your hair wet.</h4>

                    <p>After your first 2 weeks if you do want to go swimming
                    try and keep you hair out the water as much as possible.
                    Tie it up and try not to get it wet, or simply use a
                    swimming cap to ensure it stays a dry as possible. It's
                    always better to keep the hair dry, however if don't like
                    the idea of a swim cap, or you swim everyday and you hair
                    just always ends up wet, you can use the 'Oil Defence
                    Serum'. This isn't a great as keeping it dry, but it will
                    help reduce colour fade if you are a bit of a mermaid and
                    can resist the water.</p>

                    <h4>9. Sunlight will cause the colour to fade.</h4>

                    <p>So pop a hat on when you sunbathe. (But if you're a
                    vampire that's the least of your worries!).</p>

                    <h4>10. Parting trick:</h4>

                    <p>If you normally part you hair in the same place you will
                    notice the colour fading on the part first, again due to
                    this hair being exposed to the light the most in this area.
                    To save having to dye you hair again so soon, simply try
                    parting your hair another way. The hair in the areas
                    underneath will not have been exposes to the light as much
                    and will be more vibrant. This great little trick of
                    changing the parting will often have people asking "Did you
                    re-colour your hair?" :)</p><br>

                <h3>What can I do to make my semi-permanent hair colour fade
                faster?</h3>

                <p>Easy! Simply so the total opposite of all the tips above. Go
                swimming and get your hair wet, shampoo everyday with a deep
                cleansing shampoo, go play outdoors in the sunshine (but don't
                forget to wear suncream!) and take nice steaming hot showers.
                You colour will be very pastel by the end of the week.</p>

                <h3>How can I stop the colour rubbing off on everything?</h3>

                <p>Some brands and shades (such as Punky Color), stain, bleed
                and rub off on everything your hair comes into contact with.
                Pillow cases, white clothes, bath towels. Of course I generally
                suggest you use old bath towels and sleeping on an old pillow
                case. However there is also an old home remedy for stopping the
                colour from rubbing off and staining everything...</p>

                <h3>Homemade Vinegar Rinse:</h3>

                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                - 1/2 White vinegar or apple cider vinegar<br>
                - 1/2 Water<br></p>

                <p><strong>Directions:</strong> Mix equal amounts of white
                vinegar or apple cider vinegar and water into bottle (or spray
                bottle) and shake. Shampoo hair, rinse with water, pour vinegar
                rinse in or use a spray bottle and spray it in, leave for 5min,
                rinse, (note: hair will feel strange) condition as normal (now
                hair will feel super soft and smooth).</p>

                <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Can be drying if done to often. I
                recommended doing this once or twice after colouring, but not
                every time you wash your hair.</p>

                <p>Vinegar lowers the pH level of the hair, locking the cuticle
                layer down and the colour in. Locking the cuticle layer helps
                the colour last longer, and because the cuticle layer is now
                flat and smooth, light reflects off the hair, giving it a great
                shine. It is also clarifying and helps remove product build up
                and excess dye, great if your colour won't stop running and
                bleeding everywhere and rubs off on everything it touches. Also
                conditioner works better at a lower pH level, so when you
                condition after the doing the vinegar rinse it holds and
                absorbs into the hair better, so use a good conditioner for
                best results.</p>

                <h3>What shampoo and conditioner should I use?</h3>

                <p>Like hair dye, finding the right shampoo and conditioner is
                like finding your favourite favour of ice cream. It's a
                personal taste. So where one product may work great for one
                person, the same product might feel nasty to another person.
                Because everyone's hair is different and so has different
                needs. That is why there are so many products on the market.
                You might love a shampoo because it makes your hair feel super
                sleek, straight and shiny, but your friend might use the same
                shampoo and say it feels flat, heavy and oily. This is because
                you have different types of hair and different needs. So I
                would encourage you to experiment and try different brands
                until you find what works for you and your hair.</p><br>

                            <p>Did you know that the word 'Shampoo' came from
                            India and is derived from the Hindi word "Chāmpo"
                            which means head massage.</p>

                </div>
                <p>

                <p>However if you if you want your colour to last longer I
                would always recommend a sulfate free shampoo.</p>

                <h3>What Is sulfate free?</h3>

                <p>So sulfate is the thing in the majority of cleaning products
                (e.g., shampoo, toothpaste, body wash) that strips away the
                dirt and oil and creates that nice thick lather. Problem is it
                also strips away colour. If your looking for the technical
                names in the ingredients list on your shampoo look for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)</li>

                    <li>Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)</li>

                    <li>Ammonium Laurel Sulfate (ALS)</li>
                </ul><br>

                <p>Although most sulfate free shampoo these days will advertise
                on the front saying "Sulfate Free" which makes picking the
                right shampoo much easier. Also a lot of colour safe shampoos
                don't use this ingredient anymore. The only things with a
                sulfate free shampoo is that it won't create that nice thick
                lather, but it will still clean the hair without stripping out
                the colour.</p>

                <h3>What shampoo do you recommended for helping the colour to
                last?</h3>

                <p>Here are a few sulfate free shampoo's that I really like,
                and don't feel that you have to use the same conditioner to go
                with it. Conditions don't contain sulfate's anyway. It's not
                there job to clean so they don't need it. Also conditioner
                doesn't strip colour so you don't need a "colour safe"
                conditioner. They are designed to add add moisture to the hair,
                not remove things like dirt or colour. So I normally suggest to
                use a 'colour safe' sulfate free shampoo and a nourishing
                conditioner to help add moisture back into the bleached hair. I
                DON'T recommended 2in1 shampoo and conditioner, as they don't
                do either job properly. Here are a few shampoo's I like, but
                also remember try different things and experiment because
                everyone's hair is different.</p>

                <br></p>

                <p>So this would be my first choice in shampoo, however it is a
                salon only product so it's not for those on a budget. However
                this is what I use on my clients in the salon everyday and I
                just love it. It's designed for 'delicate' colours, in other
                words vibrant colour such as red's, plums, coppers... colours
                that wash out fast. So it's perfect for maintaining rainbow
                colours. It doesn't give much lather, but that's because it's
                sulfate free. They do also have a regular sulfate version for
                those with less delicate hair colour who want to get a lather.
                It's called 'Vitamino Colour' and the bottle looks very similar
                so be sure to read it and make sure you don't pick the wrong
                one up. 'Delicate Colour' is also available in two other sizes:
                16.9oz/500ml and the massive salon basin size 50.7oz/1.5
                liters. The salon size is the best value for money and you can
                get it from salon suppliers so you don't have to pay retail.
                The 50.7oz/1.5 liters is around $60 (USD) which works out to be
                $1.18 (USD) per oz, so less than half the cost of the small
                250ml bottles. As it's an expensive shampoo anyway, this is
                a good way to help cut down the cost. The smell is light and
                girly, leaves your hair smelling lovely. Definitely keeps the
                colour nice and vibrant.</p><br>

                <p>There are three shampoos in L'Oreal's supermarket range
                'EverPure': Smooth (orange), Volume (green) and Moisture
                (pink). All three are sulfate free and are have the 'Colour
                Care' system to help prevent colour fade. They are available
                world wide in most supermarkets. Still gives a nice lather for
                a sulfate free shampoo and is 100% vegan. They contain UV
                filter to help protect colour from sunlight fade, and contain
                botanicals rosemary and juniper which give them a lovely smell
                and help to nourish the hair. I love the fact you also get a
                choice in shampoos from this range so you can use what suites
                your hair type best. This is a much cheaper option compared
                with the salon only professional range, but is still a more
                pricy product compared to other supermarket brands. But for a
                supermarket range, it's a great product and really helps
                maintain the colour.</p><br>

                <br></p>

                <p>This is an Australian brand and is only available in
                Australia. However if your on a budget this supermarket shampoo
                is only $3.45 (AUD) and available from Woolworth, Coles and
                most independent supermarkets. This shampoo is also sulfate
                free, paraben free (that's a preservative), gray water safe and
                the packaging is plant based and biodegradable. So it's super
                safe for the environment and good if you have sensitive
                skin/scalp. Also contains UV filter to help protect your
                rainbow hair colour from the sunlight. I love using this
                shampoo and you do get some lather with it which is nice,
                although you do need to use more product compared with the
                professional brands. But when it's so cheap, widely available,
                environmentally friendly and protects the colour... can't
                complain. Just wish it was available world wide.</p><br>

                <h3>What conditioner do you recommend?</h3>

                <p>I generally recommend a nourishing conditioner to help add
                moisture back into the bleached hair. Don't feel you have to
                use matching brands of shampoo and conditioner, that's more of
                a marketing thing. Shampoo and conditioner do totally different
                jobs, so it's fine to use different brands and ranges depending
                on your hairs need's. Experiment to find the right combination
                for you.</p>

                <p>This is a fantastic conditioner and I'd highly recommend it.
                It was even voted #1 Hair Care Product of 2012 in Australia.
                You can buy it at the supermarket and it's available world
                wide, so easy to get your hands on. Great for bleached hair,
                adds all the moisture back in. The size of the bottle varies
                from one country to another, but you can get it in the regular
                sizes (see above) and a large size (approx 750ml - 1ltr) which
                come with a pump top which I like and is better value for
                money. It has the classic Dove smell and a thick creamy
                texture. This is an awesome conditioner for a supermarket brand
                and great if your on a budget.</p><br>

                <p>This is awesome stuff. So it's actually designed as a
                sealing treatment to use immediately after you have dyed your
                hair. However you can also use it as a daily conditioner. It
                works by sealing the hair to help stop the colour from bleeding
                and so prolonging the life of the colour. It's also paraben
                (preservative) free and leaves hair soft, smooth, shiny and
                manageable. Also comes in a <a href=

                <p>These are professional conditioners and available in most
                salons world wide, as such they are not for those on a budget
                but they are fantastic and a little goes a long way. They are
                for those who have dyed there hair all red (such as L'Oreal
                Majicontrast reds) or all purple and will refresh your hair
                colour between dye jobs. Number 6 is for red hair and number 20
                is for purple/violet hair, (there are more colours in this
                range but they are for natural hair colours). These
                conditioners have colouring pigments that deposit colour on the
                surface of hair fibre, this helps to keep the colour vibrant
                while the apricot oil helps to condition and soften the hair.
                Because these conditioners contain colour I recommend you do a
                skin test 48 hours before you use. You apply this conditioner
                to shampooed and towel-dried hair. Leave on for 5 to 10
                minutes, then rise well.</p><br>

                <h3>Do you recommended doing treatments?</h3>

                <p>Yes! Absolutely. Especially if you bleached your hair to get
                the bright colours. Treatments will work wonders for adding
                moisture and shine back into your hair. But they do not fix
                split ends, burnt or broken hair, no matter what the adverts
                say. If you hair is very damaged in these ways to only way to
                fix it with a good hair cut. Treatments work by replacing lost
                moisture in the hair so if your hair is feeling dry, dull,
                lacking in shine or body and knots easily then a treatment will
                help make it silky, soft and shiny again. I recommend doing a
                treatment once a week and as the condition of your hair
                improves change to one a fortnight and eventually once a month
                depending on how the condition is feeling. Use your judgment to
                decide. I like to leave a treatment in the hair for a minimum
                of 15min (unless it's an instant treatment) but the longer you
                leave it in the better. I personally like to apply them in the
                evening and then go to bed with it in, and then rise out in the
                morning.</p>

                <p>WARNING: Overdoing treatments and applying to often can
                leave your hair oily, heavy and flat. This can also happen if
                you use the wrong treatment for your hair. For example, if you
                have fine hair and you use a very heavy treatment you may
                experience this. Be sure to do your research or try a test size
                first if your not sure.</p>

                avocado, cottonseed oil and grapeseed. I personally love using
                this mask and find it has helped my clients with managing and
                blow drying even course dry hair. Gives the hair an awesome
                shine and despite having the word 'Oil' in it's name it doesn't
                weigh the hair down or make it oily. Argan oil is one of the
                most popular ingredients in hair treatments and I highly
                recommended it. It absorbs into the hair much better than
                silicon based products the simply coat the surface. Direction
                say leave in for 3min but I like to do 15min or more. This also
                come in a larger size (500ml).</p><br>

                <p>If your on a budget or just looking for a products that are

                your own hair products is fun, easy and awesome for your hair.
                It's also a great option if you have eczema or an allergy to
                silicones, parabens or fragrances found in most cosmetics.</p>

                <h3>Homemade Avocado Intensive Treatment</h3>

                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                - 1 egg<br>
                - 1 mashed avocado<br>
                - 3 tablespoons coconut milk</p>

                <p><strong>Directions:</strong><br>
                Crack the egg into a blender and add the flesh of one ripe
                avocado. Blend all the items in the blender until the mixture
                is combined well and is smooth. Then add the coconut milk (you
                may also add a couple drops of lavender or rosemary essential
                oil to the blender if you wish). Blend again until completely
                mixed.</p>

                <p>Needs to be used in 1 day, as the egg will not keep. Apply
                to clean towel dried hair. Leave for 15-20 min, then rise out
                with cool water only.</p>

                <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do NOT use hot water, or it will
                cook the egg into your hair creating omelet hair. Yum.</p>

                <p>Avocados contain more than 25 essential nutrients and
                vitamins, such as Vitamin E and B-vitamins. They are rich with
                proteins which help hair regain it's nutrition, elasticity,
                shine and body.</p><br>

                <h3>Is there anything I can use to protect my colour from sun
                fade, pool &amp; sea water?</h3>

                <p>Obviously if you can do you best not to get your hair wet
                when swimming, tie it up or wear a swim cap. Or if you sunning
                or outdoors all day, popping a colourful hat or scarf over your
                hair, is always the best option. However I understand that swim
                cap's and hats are not for everyone. So if your a sun worshiper
                or a mermaid there are some tricks you can use to help protect
                your fabulous vibrant hair colour from the harsh UV rays,
                chlorine and saltwater...</p>

                <div style="margin-left: 2em">
                    <p><strong>1. Wet your hair with tap water before you
                    swim.</strong> Since your hair is porous, it will soak up
                    the Chlorine water as much as it can, so by wetting your
                    hair with regular water beforehand, you’re already filling
                    up much of the space the hair can absorb.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Use a 'Sun and pool' leave-in protecting
                    conditioner.</strong> Any leave in conditioner is going to
                    help coat the hair and protect it from the chlorine, but
                    better still if you can get one with SPF in that will
                    protect against the sun as well. Apply this after you have
                    wet your hair with regular water.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Don't use peroxide, lemon juice, and "sun
                    activated hair lightening" products.</strong> These will
                    damage, dry out and strip the colour in the sun.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Cover your hair while sunbathing.</strong>
                    Although there are lots of UV protecting hair products that
                    will help stop the colour from fading, nothing beats a
                    hat.</p>

                <p>Also know as "SUN &amp; SPORT LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER". This
                product not only protects hair from sun, chlorine, and salt
                water, but it's also designed for curly hair. This is a
                professional salon product and as such it's not for those on a
                budget. However it's awesome for coloured curly hair and it is
                paraben free. It uses proteins and amino acids to seal in
                moisture and nourish the curl, while shielding the colour with
                UV block from overexposure to the drying effects of the sun,
                sea and pool. Spray anytime on dry, damp, or wet hair before
                and during outdoor activities (particularly in the sun, sea and
                pool). Work through hair with fingers or a wide-tooth comb.
                Always reapply after swimming. Sun shield is also available in
                a larger size (33.8oz) for $63 (USD) which works out better
                value for money.</p><br>

                <h3>Homemade Sun, Sea and Pool Defense</h3>

                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                - 1/4 Water-Resistant SPF 30 Sunscreen<br>
                - 3/4 olive, jojoba or coconut oil</p>

                <p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

                <p>This is an easy at home way to prevent damage caused by sun,
                chlorine and salt water. Simply mix the sunscreen in with your
                chosen oil, (I personally love the coconut oil best for a sunny
                holiday scent) and store in a small bottle to keep in your
                pool/beach bag.</p>

                <p>When applying, wet your hair first with regular shower
                water. Then work through your homemade defense serum. Don't use
                to much, size of a 20c will be plenty. If you over do it it
                will become hard to wash out later. Use a comb to work it
                though, it's important to get an even distribution. The oil
                will act as a barrier and water proof your hair from the pool
                (like a wetsuit!) and the sunscreen will block out those nasty
                rays.</p>

                <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> You must NOT wash out with hot
                water.</p>

                <p>Oil is quickly dissolved and pulled out with hot water, and
                will strip your hair of all the good stuff. So to wash out this
                oil based defense serum simply mix up your shampoo with some
                cool to luke warm water in a small bowl. Then in the shower
                pour this onto your hair. Massage through thoroughly then rinse
                out with cool to luke warm water.</p><strong>Note:</strong>

                <p>If you don't plan on swimming an just want UV protection for
                your hair while outdoors it's very easy to make. Simply dilute
                1/4 SPF 30 suncream (regular, NOT Water-Resistant) down with
                3/4 of water. Mix together in a bowl and then pop it into a
                spray bottle to use. To apply, simply spray the product into
                your damp hair before styling. For additional protection, you
                can mist the solution on throughout the day. Don't forget to
                give it a quick shake before re-applying.</p><br>

                <h3>What Dry Shampoo do you recommend?</h3>

                <p>So dry shampoo is the best. Even if you don't have colourful
                hair, it's perfect for dirty little fairy's like me who would
                pick a sleep in the morning over shampooing. The way it works
                is by adding a fine powdery mist on the hair that adsorbs the
                oil, taking away the greasy/oiliness from the roots. Because of
                the powdery texture it also adds lots of extra volume and body
                to the hair. So it's great for lots of things...</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>People with naturally oily scalp don't have to shampoo
                    everyday</li>

                    <li>People with fine hair who want volume and body</li>

                    <li>Stretching out a blow-dry a few more days</li>

                    <li>Saves hair and scalp from over washing</li>

                    <li>Saves hair colour from being washed out</li>

                    <li>Saves time when you need a quick fix</li>

                    <li>Adds volume and grip to hair for up-styling and teased
                    styles</li>
                </ul><br>

                <p>There are lots of dry shampoos on the market and as with all
                products I'd encourage you to experiment to find the right
                thing for your hair. Most dry shampoos come in an aerosol that
                sprays a white mist, or in a bottle/tub of white powder.
                Because the product is normally white you need to be careful
                not to apply to much, rub it in with your fingers and brush it
                through. If you apply to much, don't rub it in or brush you
                will have white powder on you roots, not a good look. I
                normally suggest only applying it to your parting, crown and
                hairline (the most obviously greasy areas) and then working it
                through from there. A little goes a long way. These are a
                couple of product I personally like...</p>

                <p>This brand is fantastic. It has been around since the 70's,
                it specializes in only dry shampoo and has won heaps of awards.
                Comes in a wide range of scents so your hair smells lovely and
                there is something for everyone to choose from. It's available
                world wide from most supermarkets and drugstores. Good value
                for money compared with professional brands, especially if your
                in the UK, where you can get even bigger cans (200ml) for only
                £2.99. They also have a range of coloured dry shampoo's, Deep
                Brown, Brunette, Blonde and Red, which aren't white in colour
                like regular dry shampoo, but have colour. The Red is
                particularly vibrant, so perfect for those with Rhianna red all
                over. Also because the product is applied to the roots it can
                also help to blend and disguise re-growth. Perfect for a quick
                fix when your getting close to the time to re-dye. Batiste dry
                shampoo also comes in handbag/travel sized mini's (50ml), super
                cute and very handy. Apply Batiste by spaying it approximately
                8 inch's away from your head, into your parting, crown and
                hairline (the most obviously greasy areas) and then working it
                through by rubbing it in with you finger tips and then brushing
                it out. Style as normal.</p><br>

                            shampoo's, use it before you do your make-up. When
                            you go around the hairline, the colour in the spray
                            will leave your forehead coloured. It's easily
                            wiped off, but would be annoying if you have just
                            applied your make up and have to wipe it all off
                            and re-apply.</p>

                <p>This is a professional product, so not for those on a
                budget, however it's my favorite dry shampoo out there. Has a
                lovely fresh floral scent, it sprays and a fan like way (rather
                than a blast of product like most other brands), giving better
                control of the amount applied. You get lots of product in a
                can, so it lasts well. It's also not as heavy in your hair, you
                don't feel like you have a dry shampoo in it, but it still
                works in removing the grease. Plus I find it doesn't leave
                obvious white residue in your hair compared with other
                professional brands.</p><br>

                <h3>Homemade DRY SHAMPOO:</h3>

                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                - 10g cornstarch<br>
                - 40g water<br>
                - 10g rubbing alcohol</p>

                <p><strong>Directions:</strong><br>
                Pour all the ingredients together in a bowl, and mix them
                together. Should look like a white liquid. Then pour the
                mixture into a spray bottle and give it a shake. To apply
                simply spray onto root area or any oily/greasy areas. Use a
                comb or your finger to pull it through the hair and distribute
                evenly. Then leave to dry naturally or blast it out with a
                hairdryer. Repeat if necessary.</p>

                <p>Corn starch works by absorbing the natural oil on the hair
                and scalp, taking away the 'greasy' look. The rubbing alcohol
                is anti-bacterial, killing any germs and helps to dry out oily
                scalp.</p>

                <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> You do not need to drench your
                hair and scalp, just dampen it. Don't over do
                it.</p><strong>Note:</strong>

                <p>If your in a hurry and don't have time to apply and
                blow-dry, or your hair is already nicely blow-dried and you
                don't want to wet it there is the quick fix option. Simply
                sprinkle a little cornstarch in the parting, hairline or most
                obviously oily/greasy areas. Then gently rub it into the hair.
                Careful not to use to much or it will make your hair look
                white.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=

                </header>

                <p>The fun with the semi-permanent direct dyes is that you can
                swap and change all the time with zero dammage. I personally
                like to change my colour combination each time I touch up the
                roots. However you do get a slight residue left in the hair
                even after the dye has washed out. This residue can be annoying
                when trying to change to another colour as sometimes it can
                effect the result. Let me give you some examples to show you
                what I mean...</p>

                <h4>Example 1:</h4>

                <p>If you have had red in your hair the last time, your will
                have a peachy residue left on the hair. If you then want to put
                blue over it the result will be more of a indigo
                (purplish-blue) colour.</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/Example1%20future%20changes.png">

                <h4>Example 2:</h4>

                <p>If you had blue on your hair last time, you will have an
                pale blue residue left. If you then want to put yellow over it,
                the result will be more of a lime (yellow-green)
                colour.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/Example2%20future%20changes.png">

                <p>So to get an idea what the result will be, just think of it
                like paint. In fact, I suggest you try experiment mixing paints
                to help you get a better understanding of how colour mixing
                works. The colour wheel here is also a good indication of the
                results you will get when mixing certain colours
                together.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/Colour%20Wheel2%20Mixing.png">

                <p>Now if you don't want this result, and you want a very true
                colour then you will need to clean the residue out of your
                hair...</p>

                <h3>How do I remove old residue colour?</h3>

                <p>Bleach is the most effective way to remove the old residue
                colours. However it is also the most damaging, as the hair you
                are putting it on as is already bleached. So the way we
                minimize the amount of damage is by diluting the bleach mix.
                The residue is from the semi-permanent direct dye so it will
                lift out the hair very quickly and easily. This is because
                direct dye pigments only sit on the surface of the hair, unlike
                permanent dye, where the pigments sit inside the hair. This
                means the diluted bleach mix will be strong enough to cleanse
                the residue pigments off the surface of the hair. This method
                is called a 'Bleach Bath' (sometimes referred to as 'Soap
                Capping').</p>

                <h3>How to do a Bleach Bath:</h3>

                <p>First we need to dilute the bleach to make the Bleach Bath
                mixture. You mix your normal bleach and peroxide first. Only
                use 6% (20vol) peroxide. Then add water. Mix the water and bleach
                in a 1:1 ratio. So if you mixed 30g bleach add 30g water.
                Finally add a few squirts of your regular shampoo to the mix.
                Just use the same amount as you would normally to wash you hair
                with. Then mix it all together. Here is a diagram to help
                explain what I mean...</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/bleachbathmix.png"><br>

                <h4>How to apply a Bleach Bath:</h4>

                <p>If you had a full head bleach before you can simply apply
                the mix like you would a shampoo. Gently rubbing it in all over
                and through the mid-lengths and ends. Rember to wear gloves. If
                you have your natural hair and only parts with colour, like
                streaks, dip-dye or panels, you need to clip as much of your
                natural hair out the way and apply the Bleach Bath to only
                those residue colour areas. Try to be careful not to get it on
                your natural hair, as it will start to lighten it slightly. It
                should start to cleanse out the residue as soon as it's on the
                hair, you should see the residue lifting out. You can work
                visually or use a timer, but it should only take 5-10min
                <img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/5-10min.png">before you should rinse it out. Please
                remember this is still a bleach and you are putting it over
                already bleached hair, so 10min is the maximum it should be
                left on. If you can still see residue rise it off anyway. Once
                rinsed off do a regular shampoo with just shampoo to make sure
                the Bleach Bath is all washed out.</p>

                <h3>What if the residue colour didn't come out?</h3>

                <p>Some residues can be very stubborn. I find particularly if
                you had used a brand like Special Effects, which is very long
                lasting, the residue can in fact be a permanent stain on the
                hair. I have found 'Atomic Pink' by Special Effects to be one
                of the worst for leaving a permanent stain, also orange and
                yellow colours in most brands are stubborn to remove, as they
                are similar to the brassy tone you get naturally in bleached
                hair. Other reasons you may have a permanent stain on the hair
                is if you have been repeatedly using the same colours over and
                over. Or in some cases you may have naturally very porous,
                absorbent hair that has simply grabbed the colour and won't let
                go.</p>

                <p>In these cases you won't be able to remove the permanent
                residue stain. You may however be able to lighten it a little
                with a regular bleach. But I've found even if you used
                12% (40vol) peroxide over these kind of stains you still won't be
                able to remove them, and it will only damage the hair. If you
                do wish to try and lighten them with a regular bleach mix, only
                use 6% (20vol) peroxide, maxim time this should be left on for is
                10min. Also only do this if your hair is in good, strong
                condition. Use the 'elasticity test' described in the 'Safe
                Pre-Lightening' chapter to determine this. I don't recommend
                you do this if you have fine weak hair. If you have permanent
                stain on the hair, and can't or don't want to do a regular
                bleach to lighten it, you can still change colour, we will
                simply have a slightly limited colour palette to chose
                from.</p><br>

                <h3>How do I remove old residue colour without bleach?</h3>

                <p>Let me introduce to you Base Breaker. This is the most
                gentle way to remove residue colour, and I would recommend
                trying this first before doing a Bleach Bath or a second
                regular bleach. It's ammonia free, works in 10 min and it's not
                a bleach...</p>

                <p>This product is intended for professionals only, but if you
                go to a salon supplier you can get your hands on some. You can
                also buy it online. It's designed to lighten natural hair by
                only one level in 10min without ammonia. However when I was
                first introduced to this product they also mentioned it was
                great for cleansing brassy tones off bleached highlights
                without having to re-bleach. So I figure if it can clean brassy
                tones from bleached hair, why not residue tones from old
                rainbow colours? So like all good hairdressers I had to
                experiment with the idea, and was delighted to find it works a
                treat. I found with a pastel residue it can get it right back
                to blonde in 10min, and the condition of the hair is still
                maintained.</p>

                <p>The smell of this product is like acetone in nail polish
                remover. The consistency is a liquid and it must be mixed in
                equal parts with 6% (20vol) peroxide (For example: 10g Base
                Breaker + 10g 6% (20vol) peroxide). After 10min it will stop
                working. If you mix with a higher level of peroxide it will
                still have the same result as with 6% (20vol) peroxide. On darker
                residue colours it will only lighten it to a more pastel tone.
                This is not a bleach and will not remove darker residue
                colours, or lighten permanent stains on the hair. I've put
                together a chart (click above) of expected results to help give
                you an idea of how this works.</p><br>

                <h3>What colours can I do without removing the old
                residue?</h3>

                <p>Lots! There are plenty of options for changing your colour
                without having to remove the residue tone at all. The trick it
                to use the colour wheel to help understand how the colours
                work. Also I find using deeper colours over the pastel residue
                help to ensure you a nice true, even colour. Not removing the
                residue is THE best way to maintain beautiful healthy hair. I
                rarely clean out the residue in my own hair and am changing
                colours every month or so. The only time I remove residue tone
                is when I change to a colour that is opposite each other on the
                colour wheel. Let me give you some examples of when residues
                have no effect on the result...</p>

                <h4>Example 1:</h4>

                <p>If you have had red in your hair the last time, you will
                have a peachy residue left on the hair. If you then want to put
                pink over it the result will be pink. Why? Because pink is made
                up of red.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/Example1%20pink.png">

                <h4>Example 2:</h4>

                <p>If you have had red in your hair the last time, you will
                have a peachy residue left on the hair. If you then want to put
                purple over it the result will be purple. Why? Because purple
                is made up of red.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage"
                src="images/Example%202%20purple.png">

                <h4>Example 3:</h4>

                <p>If you have had blue in your hair the last time, you will
                have a pale blue residue left on the hair. If you then want to
                put purple over it the result will be purple. Why? Because
                purple is made up of blue.</p><img alt="Image" class=
                "centeredImage" src="images/Example%203%20purple.png">

                <h4>Example 4:</h4>

                <p>If you have had blue in your hair the last time, you will
                have a pale blue residue left on the hair. If you then want to
                put green over it the result will be green. Why? Because green
                is made up of blue.</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage"

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>For a true result use a deep colour over the
                            pastel residue. If the new colour is to light the
                            residue can still effect the result.</p>

                <h4>Example of when a light colour is used over the
                residue:</h4>

                <p>If you have had blue in your hair the last time, you will
                have a pale blue residue left on the hair. If you then want to
                put LIGHT green over it the result will be teal.</p><img alt=
                "Image" class="centeredImage" src="images/Example%20teal.png">

                <h3>Can I change to an opposite colour over time without
                removing the old residue?</h3>

                <p>Yes! Absolutely. If you not in a hurry to change colour you
                can work you way around the colour wheel until you reach your
                desired shade. This is a great way to get a few different looks
                while also saving your hair from unnecessary bleaching and
                damage. Let me give you an example so you can see how this is
                done...</p><img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/change%20colour%20over%20time.png">

                <p>So hopefully your getting the idea of how this works. You
                can also use the colour wheel and colour mixing formulas in the
                'Mixing Shades' chapter as a reference to help you work out
                what results you will get. If you're still not sure simply
                to a strand test (see the 'Safe Pre-Lightening' chapter on how
                to do this) to see exactly what the result will be. The more
                you experiment with colour, the better your understanding will
                be. Remember the semi-permanent 'Direct Dyes' are very
                conditioning to the hair. They are totally safe to re-apply
                again and again to refresh and change your colour as often as
                you like with zero damage. So have fun!</p>

                <p>Remember, it's best to work with the residue, and use
                similar colours, rather then do totally opposite colours in the
                colour wheel. This way you won't need to remove the residue and
                the condition of your hair will feel great. The more often you
                clean out the old residue, the dryer you hair will feel each
                time. If you are using a bleach bath or regular bleach,
                limit the number of times you do this to 2. Any more than that
                and you will risk damage and breakage. The hair has already
                been bleached once, so be kind to it.</p><img alt="Image"

                <p>This style is that super sexy, teased up, mat finish, bed
                head look. It's very easy and great fun to do. This look works
                best on choppy layered hair and shorter hair styles. For
                example, emo or scene style hair cuts, fohawks and short messy
                Mohawks, pixie cuts... think Pink's hair in her 'So What' music
                video riding the lawnmower. Can be done on long hair, but only
                where it's very layered. Wouldn’t work on long one length hair.
                Also best suited to naturally straight hair.<img alt="Image"

                "images/hairspray.png"><strong>Hairspray.</strong> I like ‘Hard
                Head’ hairspray from the ‘Bed Head’ range by TIGI, or
                'Skyscraper" hairspray in the professional range by Fudge.</p>

                <h4>What To Do:</h4>

                <p>After washing your hair, while it is till slightly damp
                after towel drying, apply the root lift spray. Focus on spaying
                the roots and on the areas you want most hight. Now roughly
                blow dry your hair off with your hair flicked upside down. This
                with help to start creating volume in the roots. Make sure it's
                100% dry. Then once the hair is all dry apply the magic
                volumizing dust. Simply sprinkle directly onto you hair, again
                focus on the roots. Once you have applied the dust evenly, use
                your finger tips and massage the dust into your hair, as if you
                where shampooing. You should be starting to get a lot of
                texture and volume. The dust is slightly sticky and rubbing it
                into the hair should give you and instant back-comb effect.</p>

                <p>Now take the teasing brush and go to town with it. Lift up
                the areas you want the highest and brush the hair back onto the
                roots. If you have a Mohawk do this all the way through the
                length of it. If you have an emo or scene hairstyle focus the
                teasing on the crown area. If you have a pixie cut or shorter
                style and want to quiff up the front, use the teasing brush to
                create the quiff. The products we put in earlier will help to
                hold the teased hair. If there are any areas you want smoother,
                for example the fringe, simply use the teasing brush as a
                normal brush and brush out the hair smoothly.</p><br>

                <p>Finally once you are happy with how the teased hair is
                looking, use the hairspray to set it. The best way to do this
                and still encourage the volume and body is the lift the teased
                hair up and spay the hairspray into the roots to help set in a
                good solid foundation. Then once this is done take the teasing
                brush again and just add the finishing touches, teasing up or
                smoothing out whatever areas you like until you are satisfied
                with the finished look. Then give a final squirt of hairspray
                all over to freeze it all in place. Two things to remember when
                using hairspray. First: always hold at arms length away from
                you, any closer and you won't get even cover, and you may get
                hard patches of crispy hair. Yuk. Second: Don't overload the
                hair. You want it to stay but not turn rock solid. Once you
                have overloaded on hairspray you can't go back, so do little
                squirts at a time.</p>

                <h4>What NOT To Do:</h4><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Don't use wax, this stuff is far to oily and will
                        leave your hair slimy and greasy looking. DAX WAX is
                        the worst. It's impossible to wash out of the hair. I
                        washed a clients hair 6x, even with washing up liquid,
                        and still it would not budge.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Don’t use gel. This stuff drys to a hard and
                        unnatural. Leaves your hair looking wet and feeling
                        like a rock.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Don’t use mousse. This is meant for curly hair
                        anyway, not short. But will also dry too crispy.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you want this messy, bedhead, teased up look, but can’t
                afford the professional products, find something similar in the
                supermarket or pharmacy. Find a hairspray with strong hold but
                no shine. You can also tease hair with a comb, it's not as
                easy as with the teasing brush, but still another option. The
                root lift spay and magic dust are not essential, but again will
                make this style much easier to do.</p>

                <h3>The Style: Vanishing trick</h3>

                <p>So sadly there are times when your beautiful rainbow has to
                be hidden, for things like work, school, interviews or
                weddings. But you don't want to dye it back to natural after
                all your hard work. So how can you hide such bright hair? Well
                if you have a panel of rainbow or bright colour in the
                underneath, and natural colour in the top then it is possible.
                Let me show you a little magic trick...</p>

                <h4>What you need:</h4>

                <p><img alt="Image" class="floatLeft" src=

                hair pin.<img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/hairspray.png"></p>

                <p><strong>Hairspray.</strong> I like ‘Hard Head’ hairspray
                from the ‘Bed Head’ range by TIGI, or 'Skyscraper" hairspray by
                Fudge.</p><img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=
                "images/clips2.png">

                <p><strong>Plastic Sectioning Clips</strong> My personal
                favourite is the double-hinged design <a href=
                "http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-3670582-10650864?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sallybeauty.com%2Fhair-clips%2FSBS-702122%2Cdefault%2Cpd.html&amp;cjsku=SBS-702122"

                they have a very strong grip, never slip from the hair and are
                great for holding thick sections of hair.</p>

                <h4>What To Do:</h4>

                <p>After washing your hair, blow dry and style as normal. Then
                use a plastic sectioning clip to clip up all your natural hair
                on top leaving out the colourful hair.</p><img alt="Image"
                class="centeredImage" src="images/Vanish%20trick.png"><br>

                <p>Then separate the rainbow hair into two parts. Start on one
                half, twist the hair around and up into a mini bun. Use the
                bobby pins to hold it on place and a little hairspray to fix
                it. Repeat on the other half. You should end up with two small
                low buns of rainbow hair. Give your head a shake to test that
                they feel secure and don't come lose.</p><img alt="Image"
                class="centeredImage" src="images/Vanish%20trick%202.png"><br>

                <p>Then upclip the natural hair from the top and let it fall
                over the rainbow mini buns concealing them. If you want you can
                tease the hair on top a little to give it extra fullness, and
                use a little hairspray to add some hold.</p><img alt="Image"
                class="centeredImage" src="images/Vanish%20trick%203.png"><br>
                <img alt="Image" class="centeredImage" src=
                "images/Vanish%20trick%204.png"><br>

                <h4>What not to do:</h4>

                <p>Don't make you mini buns to big or they might poke out. If
                you have a lot of hair, do three buns to help spread it
                out.</p>

                <p>Don't GHD straighten your hair on top. If it is to flat and
                straight the buns will look like bumps under the hair. Hair
                with body, wave or even curls will work best for this
                disappearing act.</p><br>

                </figure>

                <p>Curly hair, when not managed well, can be a
                pain...literally! Trying to comb thick curls can be agony. Your
                lovely curly hair can get frizzy, feel dry and lack shine. You
                would straighten it - but it takes hours. Blow-drying with
                a round brush never looks as good as how they do it in the
                salon. So you end up just tying it up, or leaving it to dry
                naturally. Which can look OK on a good day, but usually it ends
                up fluffy and dreading itself.</p>

                <p>So how do you get those beautiful soft, silky ringlets you
                see on TV?</p>

                <p>Styling curly hair is easier then you might think. I call
                this simple style 'Twisted Curls' and it's an easy style that
                gives you a soft, natural, frizz-free curl. .</p>

                "images/bumbleandbumble.png"><strong>Curl Cream.</strong> Curly
                hair needs the right styling product. Lots of brands do curl
                cream these days, and they are perfect for achieving a lovely
                soft, natural curl, but still holding down the frizz. <img alt=
                "Image" class="floatLeft" src="images/moroccan%20oil.png">My
                personal favourite is Bumble and Bumble's range "Curl
                Conscious", as they specialise in curly hair products for all
                hair types.</p>

                <p>Another popular brand for curl cream is Moroccan Oil. The
                Argon oil in their products also nourishes the hair like a
                leave-in treatment, pricey but good.<img alt="Image" class=
                "floatRight" src="images/PlayBall.png"></p>

                <p><img alt="Image" class="floatLeft" src=

                Candy" from the Playball range by L'Oreal professional is a
                good one, I love the smell, fruity and delicious.</p>

                <p><strong>Diffuser.</strong> A 'diffuser' is one of the
                extensions you can get for a hair dryer. It's large and round
                with little prongs on the inside of it. It'd deigned to dry
                curly hair. <img alt="Image" class="floatRight" src=

                <h4>What To Do:</h4>

                <p>Use a 20c size squirt of the Curl Cream and distribute
                evenly through clean towel dried hair. Focus on the mid lengths
                and ends of the hair. Don't put it all on the roots or it may
                end up looking greasy. Use a less product if you have fine/thin
                hair.</p>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/twist.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>Once you have applied the Curl Cream, take small sections of
                your hair and twirl each section around your fingers. By
                twisting each section of hair around your finger you are
                putting it into a ringlet, and the Curl Cream will help to
                stick and hold the ringlet together. For bigger curls take
                bigger sections. You can use a sectioning clip to help you
                separate sections and manage the hair as you twist.</p>

                <p>Personally I like to twist from the bottom layer and work my
                way up the head until all the hair has been twisted into
                ringlets. If you have thick curly hair you can just leave this
                to dry naturally for a smooth, frizz-free curl. If you have
                finer curly hair or just like more body/volume in your hair,
                you can diffuse dry with a hair dryer and diffuser...</p>

                <h4>How to diffuse dry your twisted curl:</h4><br>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>To diffuse dry your hair attach the diffuser to the
                        end of your hair dryer.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Tilt your head so your hair is hanging away from
                        your head. (You can do this by hanging your head upside
                        down or to the side, whatever is more comfortable for
                        you.) This helps the air to circulate and adds more
                        volume.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Set the hair dryer to a high heat but a low speed.
                        (A fast speed will fluff up the hair too much and give
                        you the poodle look, probably not what you want.)</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Scoop up the ringlets inside the diffuser head, so
                        that they scrunch up and curl around the little prongs
                        on the inside of the diffuser.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Hold the diffuser a few inches away from your head
                        with the hair scrunched up inside the head of it, and
                        hold it for about 10 sec before moving onto the next
                        area. Continue this until the hair it about 60%-70% dry
                        and they leave the rest to dry naturally. If you dry it
                        off totally you will find your hair becomes frizzy.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Once you have finished flip your head up the right
                        way and give it a little shake, and Voilà! Perfect,
                        frizz-free curls.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Don't use mousse. It's is a big no-no. When mousse
                        dries it goes hard and crispy. Yuk. Curl cream is the
                        best way to soft, healthy, nourished, natural
                        curls.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Don't run your fingers through your hair. You will
                        just be pulling out all your hard work and your
                        beautiful curls. If you must play with your hair just
                        twist it around your fingers to encourage the
                        ringlets.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Don't comb/brush your hair when it's dry. This will
                        just turn your curl into a frizzy mess and it's much
                        hard to comb dry curls, causing pain and ripping hair
                        out. Instead comb/brush your hair in the shower after
                        you have shampooed and with plenty of conditioner on
                        it. This will get out the knots with out ripping your
                        hair.</p>

                <p>Nobody need's to wear makeup, and if your not a makeup
                person don't feel like you have to. But it is fun! Even if I
                wear nothing else, I love my bright, Marilyn Monroe, red lippy.
                But everyone has there own look, and of course it has to work
                with your style, hair colour and fashion sense. You might be
                more on the dark side of the force, and like more of a Marilyn
                Manson makeup look. Or maybe you a real artist and love to do
                elaborate, full face, David Bowie style creations.</p>

                <p>However I do find if you have a full head of bright colour,
                the face can look a bit lost and empty by comparison without a
                little makeup boost. Whereas if you have just a few bright
                streaks in your natural hair, then no makeup is needed. If you
                are new to playing with makeup, just think of it like face
                paint and have fun. With unnatural hair colour you don't need
                to stress about 'matching natural tones'. It's more about
                creating your own look.</p>

                <h3>Do I need to dress to match my hair colour?</h3><a href=
                "http://www.katwise.com/" target="_blank">
                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/Katwise.jpg">
                </figure></a>

                <p>Chances are if like red enough to dye you hair that colour
                you will have some red in your wardrobe as well. But don't feel
                like if your hair is red all you can wear is red. Colour
                doesn't work like that. You can do lots of combinations that
                will work with red. For example some outfit colours that will
                work with red are: blue, black, lime, sliver and turquoise.
                Best of all you can do complimentary colours, this is when
                colour sit opposite each other in the colour wheel (see "Mixing
                Shades" chapter for colour wheel). So the complimentary colour
                to red is green. So red hair and a green dress will make both
                colours really pop, think Poison Ivy.</p>

                <p>Colours I find don't work with bright hair are earthy neural
                tones, such a beige and brown. Although there is always
                exceptions to that rule, for example pine green hair is a more
                earthy colour and would work for a hippie look with a brown
                poncho. Another combination that doesn't work is when colours
                are to similar. For example red hair and a fuchsia pink top
                don't work together.</p>

                <p>Of course if you have the the full rainbow in your hair it
                will go with anything. I often get asked if I coordinated my
                clothes with my hair, but I don't at all, it's just a case of
                when you have every colour in your hair one or more of them
                will inevitability match the outfit. That said I am a rainbow
                addict and have quite a multicolored wardrobe, my favorite
                piece to wear in winter is my <a onclick="open_in_user_default_browser(this.href); return false;" href="http://www.katwise.com/"
                target="_blank">Katwise</a> rainbow coat. I feel like Joseph in
                his coat of many colours.</p>

                <h3>Do I need to cut my hair differently or more often?</h3>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/cutting.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>Yes you will want to get your hair cut a bit more regularly
                (if you don't already) not so much if you only dyed a small
                panel of hair, but if you did a full head of colour you will
                find the condition needs a bit more maintenance. I normally
                recommend getting a trim every 6-8 weeks.</p>

                <p>You don't have to cut your hair differently, but you might
                want to if you want to show off the colour more. For example;
                if you did a rainbow panel in the back and you have all one
                length hair, you won't see much when you hair is down. You
                might want to consider getting layers cut into it to reveal
                more of the colour in the back. Of course it's your hair and
                your choice, and you will need to discuss it with your
                hairdresser. If you don't have a hairdresser ask people who's
                hair cut you like where they get their hair done. Once you find
                someone you like stick with them, because as they get to know
                your hair better each time they will be able to suggest things
                for your hair specifically. But by the same note, if you have
                been going to the same person for years and never come out 100%
                happy it's time to change stylist.</p>

                <p>An awesome funky hair cut will always bring out the colour
                best.</p><br>

                <h3>What do I say or do when people comment or stare?</h3>

                <figure class="marginRight">
                    <img alt="Image" src="images/taste_the_rainbow.jpg">
                </figure>

                <p>Bright hair colour will inevitably draw attention,
                especially when it looks as good as yours.</p>

                <p>If people just stare, don't think they are rude, it's just
                your colour is to mesmerizing and they can't take their eyes
                off it. I find this happens a lot when you travel to country's
                where bright hair colour isn't seen. When I travel to Malaysia,
                which is a Muslim country, most women ware burka's (head
                coverings). So you can image how people stop and stare at a
                girl with rainbow hair. So many people wanted their photo taken
                with me. So prepare yourself for the paparazzi and work on good
                photo pose. Rainbow hair is not for the camera shy.</p>

                <p>If people are nice enough to take the time to stop and tell
                you how much they like your colour, always thank them with a
                big smile. :) When people ask how you do it, I like to tell
                them it's magic. Some people ask if it's real, I like to mess
                with them and tell it grows this way, or as Dory would say "I'm
                a natural blue!" So be prepare for conversations with strangers
                and lots of random questions.</p>

                <p>I have had random little girls run up and give me hugs, and
                even grown up girls ask for a hug from a rainbow. So be
                prepared to give out free hugs. People will want to touch
                it, some will be polite and ask first, and others curiosity
                will take over and they will just reach out for a poke. They
                are just fascinated.</p>

                <p>If you don't like the idea of people staring at you, having
                your photo taken, talking to strangers or having people hug you
                or touch your hair, I wouldn't recommend dying your hair bright
                colours.</p>

                <h3>How do I photograph my hair?</h3>

                <p>Have you ever done a fantastic dye job only to find out the
                colour looks rubbish when you photograph it? This is because
                the camera needs a little help to pick up all your beautiful
                colours. Here are a few tips on how to photograph rainbow
                bright hair...</p>

                    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">8 TIPS FOR
                    PHOTOGRAPHING COLOURFUL HAIR:</h3>

                    <h4>1. Go outdoors.</h4>

                    <p>Indoor lighting will never be as good as outdoor. The
                    camera needs good lighting to pick up all the
                    colours.</p><br>

                    <h4>2. Don't use flash.</h4>

                    <p></p>If you have good outdoor lighting you won't need it
                    anyway.<br>
                    <p>

                    <h4>3. Find some shade.</h4>

                    <p>Standing in direct sunlight will wash the colours out,
                    and make you pull squinty faces if you face the sun. Not a
                    good look. Or if you turn with your back to the sun you
                    will ony get a black silhouette. Not so good for showing
                    off hair colour. Use solid shade, not shade from a
                    tree, or you will have leaf shadows all over you.</p>

                    <h4>4. Use a good camera.</h4>

                    <p></p>If you can. Even just a regular camera works better
                    than a mobile camera. If your taking photos yourself get a
                    camera with a reversible viewfinder so you can see what you
                    doing.<br>
                    <p>

                    <h4>5. Keep the background simple.</h4>

                    <p>If it is to busy it will be competing with your hair
                    colour for attention. Personally I like plain black
                    backgrounds as they really make the bright colours pop.
                    Just hang a bit of black fabric outside in the shade to
                    stand in front of.</p>

                    <h4>6. Use auto focus.</h4>

                    <p></p>Nothing worst that blurry out of focus photos, so
                    keep it sharp. Remember to give the camera a second to
                    auto focus before you take the shot.<br>
                    <p>

                    <h4>7. Take LOTS of photos.</h4>

                    <p>Don't expect to take only 1 or 2 shoots and have
                    something awesome (useless your a pro). The more you take
                    the higher the chances you will catch something good. Plus
                    it gives you chance to try different angles, expressions
                    and hair styling. Try some with your hair over your face,
                    then some with it flicked back... etc. Your not using film,
                    so go mad it won't cost you.</p>

                    <h4>8. Editing.</h4>

                    <p>So if your happy with what you got you don't feel like
                    you need to edit. But if you the kind person who likes to
                    edit be careful not to lose the colour with to many
                    filters. Instagram is fun, but some of the filters over
                    enhance the colour and make it look fake, or some of the
                    vintage ones can wash the colour out. General rule of
                    thumb, if your going to edit a photo don't make it look to
                    obviously edited.</p><br>
